To what extent do different children and children learning different languages follow the same path into language? To what extent are these paths variable or idiosyncratic? These questions about the consistency and variability of early language lead directly into the central questions of language acquisition: What, if any, are the universal mechanisms that lead to the emergence of human language? Answering these questions is complicated immensely by the fact that there is no one single event that constitutes language acquisition. Early language learning involves the accumulation of thousands of words, grammatical rules, and constructions, and takes place over the course of years of growth and millions of separate interactions. This problem of timescales makes measurement a tremendous challenge. In addition, during the period in which language emerges, language ability varies wildly from child to child and most children are at best reluctant experimental participants. These two observations mean that accurate measurement of language development across individuals is a major challenge. Parent report is one powerful method for adressing these. The MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CDI) is a simple survey instrument for measuring early language outcomes that was designed to address these issues.1 The CDI is a checklist for parents to fill out to report on their child’s progress in language. In different versions of the form, parents mark whether their child “says” or “says and understands” particular words out of a list of several hundred. Separate sections for gestures, word forms, and grammar are also present in some versions. Despite their simplicity, over the past 25 years of use, CDI forms have been shown to be reliable and valid measures of children’s early language. In addition, CDI forms have been adapted to more than 90 different languages around the world. Research based on the CDI has contributed tremendously to our understanding of the growth of language in early childhood. In this book, we examine the question of variability and consistency in early language through the lens of the CDI. This book is a product of the Wordbank project (M. C. Frank et al. 2016), which has as its goal to archive CDI data in a structured format so that it can be explored and analyzed in the service of describing vocabulary acquisition. The database currently contains data from more than 78787 CDI form administrations across 28 languages. Wordbank is also continuously growing as new researchers contribute data. We believe this database is the largest and most diverse set of data on early language acquisition currently in existence. Over the course of our work with Wordbank, we have developed a consistent framework for representing and analyzing CDI data. This framework allows us to unify a variety of influential previous analyses of CDI data. Just to take an example, one question of theoretical interest has been whether young children have an over-representation of nouns (names for things) in their vocabulary, and whether this trend is seen across languages. In Chapter 6, we develop an analytic method for measuring the size of this “noun bias” and apply the analysis to the Wordbank data. This measurement can then be compared across languages, and its variability can be estimated and compared to other measurements. Thus, one first contribution of this book is to synthesize and unify previous work. Research in early language learning often builds off a fragmentary empirical picture, in which many important theoretical conclusions are based on analyses of transcripts from a small number of children, or analyses of CDI data from English learners only. We hope that bringing together a large set of analyses of vocabulary data and implementing them consistently, openly, and reproducibly on the same dataset will help to create an empirical starting point for future work. A second contribution of the book is to develop theory treating the question of consistency and variability in early language. We develop the notion of “process universals” – that some aspects of the process of word learning may be universal across cultures and may lead to similarities in the dynamics of learning. These universals may arise due to the basic mechanisms of learning, memory, and social cognition that are at play in early vocabulary learning. This notion of process universals has a long history in the field (by Bates, Slobin and others), but the Wordbank project provides an opportunity to lend new empirical data and analytic power to these ideas. This notion is contrasted with notions of “content” or “structural” universals in which particular principles regarding the structure of languages are innately given. This set of contributions reflects an important guiding principle of our work here. Studies which at first glance seem like “mere replication” – in which a particular analysis is replicated on a larger dataset – are in fact important opportunities for theoretical development. Replicating with a larger dataset alone leads to a more precise estimate of the phenomenon, which can be used to confirm reliability, but also for quantitative comparisons and computational models. Further, increased precision allows for the examination of variability and consistency across meaningful units like children, words, instruments, or languages. Such estimates in turn are – as we argue throughout – relevant to foundational theoretical questions. Thus, there is never “mere” replication. More precise measurements sit hand and hand with better theory. Outline of the Book Although our goal is a full exploration of the phenomena of child language acquisition, the analyses we report are constrained by the structure of the data in Wordbank. At its heart, the individual instrument datasets stored in Wordbank are matrices of item by child data. Considering the data in this way (shown in Figure @ref(1_outline_diagram)), leads to a number of obvious data analytic strategies, many of which correspond directly to previous approaches to CDI data. Figure .: A graphical outline of the book. For example, averaging across items leads to by-child averages, where each child receives a comprehension or production score. Chapter 4 considers this view of the data, examining predictors of individual children’s vocabulary. Of course, chief among these is age, and developmental growth patterns as well as variability in development is considered in the first part of this chapter. But beyond age, even the limited demographic data available in Wordbank can be used to explore the data. In Chapter @ref{demographics}, we report the ways that vocabulary growth varies across gender, birth order, and maternal education (a rough but cross-cultually valid proxy for socio-economic status). These demographic predictors reveal both consistent and variable patterns across languages: while gender and birth-order effects more relatively constant, socio-economic effects vary widely in magnitude. Averaging across the other margin of the data leads to by-item averages. These can be examined in a number of different ways. First, items can be grouped into categories (both syntactic and semantic). Chapter 6 considers the categorical composition of early vocabulary, giving special consideration to the “noun bias” that is found in many – but not all – of the languages in Wordbank. Chapter 7 adopts the same approach for semantic, rather than syntactic, categories. Chapter 9 considers the growth trajectories for individual words and adopts the approach of predicting the trajectories of individual words based on both environmental and conceptual features of these words. This last approach calls for the incorporation of other resources, and so we use a variety of English and cross-linguistic resources to supplement Wordbank data in this chapter. Not all items denote individual words, however, so in Chapters 13 and 14, we consider the gesture/communication and grammatical items that are included in some CDI forms. Chapter 13 follows up on the early work of L. Fenson et al. (1994) who explored the relationship between gesture and early vocabulary. Chapter 14 explores the work of Bates and Goodman (1999) and Marchman and Bates (1994), who considered the relationship between vocabulary growth and the growth of grammar and first reported the striking relationship between these variables. Both of these chapters (as well as the rest of the book) are deeply indebted to the Batesian vision of exploring the process of language learning. The book ends with two empirical synthesis chapters. Chapter @ref{style} returns to the question of individual variation using tools built up in previous chapters to quantify differences in the style and trajectory of learning across children. And the final substantive chapter, Chapter @ref{theory}, synthesizes observations across languages for the preceding chapters to create an empirical definition for “process universals.” How to Read This Book You can read this book as a narrative monograph. If you intend to do so, we recommend you read Chapters @ref{intro} and @ref{methods} before moving on to substantive chapters of interest. We also recommend you read our theoretical synthesis in Chapter @ref{theory}. You can also read this book as a reference. If you take this approach, just dive into any chapter that is of interest, knowing that you may need to use some of the terminology defined in Chapter @ref{methods} to interpret the constructs and analyses that are used. Many of the analyses reported here were first described in earlier publications (e.g., M. C. Frank et al. 2016; ???; Braginsky et al., n.d.). Rather than reprinting these verbatim, this manuscript updates them using the unified analytic approach and larger dataset described in Chapter 3. The version of these analyses represented in the manuscript should be considered more definitive than any previously published or presented version. Static Book, Dynamic Data The dataset in Wordbank is constantly growing and changing as we add new features, new data, and new languages. In addition, as users of the data occasionally identify issues and errors, we make will make corrections to the database. In writing this manuscript, we have attempted to find a middle ground between a completely dynamic document that responds to any change in the database on the one hand and a traditional, static book on the other. A static manuscript would be a shame given the potential for dynamic extension and updating with new data. On the other hand, if the data were completely dynamic, any claim we made in prose would risk being out of date almost as soon as we wrote it. For this reason, we work using snapshots of the underlying database. Every so often, we will return to the manuscript and recompile the online edition, then check references to the data that might have changed. This build of the book is based on FIXME DATE.

The ability to communicate using language arrives with incredible rapidity – most parents judge that their child is producing words with the intent to communicate before his or her first birthday (Schneider, Yurovsky, and Frank 2015) and the onset of comprehension is even earlier (e.g., Bergelson and Swingley 2012; Tincoff and Jusczyk 1999). New words enter children’s expressive vocabularies slowly at first, but this process accelerates over the second year such that children reach an average of 300 words by 24 months and more than 60,000 by the time they graduate from high school (L. Fenson et al. 2007). At the same time, there are significant individual differences in the rate and timing of language acquisition. For example, according to detailed observational studies, although some 18-month-olds already produce 50–75 words, others produce no words at all, and will not do so until they are 22 months or older (e.g., Brown 1973; P. Bloom 2002; E. Clark 2003). Moreover, some children show increases in their rate of vocabulary growth well before the end of the 2nd year, others not until well after their 2nd birthday, and still others may not “spurt” at all (L. Fenson et al. 2007; Goldfield and Reznick 1990; Ganger and Brent 2004). Almost uniquely in cognitive development, early language learning also offers an opportunity to study both consistency and variability in a single phenomenon. Often researchers interested in consistency have measured theoretically-important, carefully-chosen phenomena using small convenience samples that suffice to show a proof-of-concept but do not provide information about variability. In contrast, work on variability between individuals has often focused on larger samples with more reliable tasks, that – perhaps as a consequence of their reliability – are less tightly linked to a particular theoretical construct of interest. And these constructs may depart from the ecological task that is of principal interest (Cronbach and Meehl 1955). Early language is a rare case where these problems are minimized. Measures of early language comprehension and production tend to be face valid and tightly linked to the construct of interest in their structure. And yet, in contrast to the measures that usually fulfill these criteria, early language measures are very closely related to the ecological task – linguistic communication – that is the theoretical target for explanation. Thus, early language is the rare case where consistency and variability can both be explored in a single set of measurements (Bates et al. 1994). Further, the nature and course of early word learning is an important window into children’s growing understanding of the world – beyond language. Early words cross-cut a variety of linguistic categories, but generally consist of names for caregivers (e.g., mama), common objects (e.g., bottle, shoe), social expressions (e.g., bye-bye), and actions or routines (e.g., peekaboo, throw) (Nelson 1973; Tardif et al. 2008). Yet this repertoire expands, and its composition can give insights into the learning mechanisms, biases, and priorities of young children. 1.1 Measuring early vocabulary Traditional studies of language development typically apply a combination of observational assessment and structured tests, frequently relying on short samples of interactions and small samples of children. Discerning both the universal features and natural variation of early lexical development has been greatly facilitated by the development of parent report instruments like the MacArthur-Bates CDI (L. Fenson et al. 1994; L. Fenson et al. 2007) and the Language Development Survey (LDS; Rescorla 1989). The CDIs in particular were developed across a period of more than 40 years. Originally designed for use in a research study (Bates 1976), the instruments have evolved from a structured interview to the current paper-and-pencil format and are now increasingly administered online [e.g., the web-cdi project; Kristoffersen et al. (2013) for Norwegian; for Slovak]. While other assessment tools exist for slightly older children, to our knowledge, no other measure allows cost-effective global language assessment for children in the critical age ranges between the emergence of language and the period when children become more able to engage in structured, face-to-face activities (around 30 months). Naturalistic observations are the other leading candidate for measurement of early language, but such observations are extremely costly and time-consuming to transcribe and annotate. These difficulties lead to a tradeoff where most studies either include dense data about a small number of children or smaller amounts of data with a larger sample size. Dense datasets currently provide the best method for in-depth study of the interaction between learning mechanisms and language input in individuals (e.g., E. Lieven, Salomo, and Tomasello 2009; B. C. Roy et al. 2015). The generalizability of these studies is necessarily limited by their small sample sizes, and sample sizes are in turn limited by the costs and practicality of gathering and transcribing such data (see e.g., Bergelson and Aslin 2017 for the state of the art). At the other end of the spectrum, assessment of many individual language samples can yield information about individual variability (e.g., Dickinson and Tabors 2001; Cartmill et al. 2013; Weisleder and Fernald 2013), but at some cost in terms of depth. In addition, naturalistic observations do not measure children’s language comprehension, a variable of interest for many early language researchers. Estimates of production vocabulary from naturalistic observation are highly correlated with the CDI within studies (e.g., Bornstein and Haynes 1998), but are likely to be affected substantially by length of the session, context, and interlocutor when comparing across studies (see e.g., Hidaka 2015 for discussion). And although there exist methods to extract insights about global vocabulary from naturalistic observation, these statistical extrapolations are relatively new and have not been validated extensively (Hidaka 2015). Other comprehension vocabulary measures are also available across some range of languages (e.g., the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test 4; L. M. Dunn and Dunn 2007), but these assessments are typically tailored for children older than 2 1/2 years. For breadth, depth, and ease of data gathering, parent report is unmatched. 1.2 The logic of parent report Parent-report instruments like the CDI and LDS take advantage of the fact that parents (or other primary caregivers) are expert observers of their child. Parent reports are based on experiences with the child which are not only more extensive than any researcher or clinician can obtain, but are more representative of the child’s ability. Parents have experience with children at play, at meals, at bath and bedtime, at tantrums – in short, with the full range of the child’s life and therefore with the full range of language structures used in these contexts. Parents also have had opportunities to hear the child interact with other people: the other parent, grandparents, siblings, and friends. Because responses on these instruments represent an aggregation over much time and many situations, they are less influenced by factors that can mask a child’s true ability in the laboratory or clinic, such as shyness or compliance, or that can impact the validity of naturalistic sampling, such as word frequency. As Bates, Bretherton, and Snyder (1991) point out, “parental report is likely to reflect what a child knows, whereas [a sample of] free speech reflects those forms that she is more likely to use.” (p. 57). The application of parent report enables the collection of data from far larger samples of children than would be possible with standardized tests or naturalistic observation. Information from more adequate samples, especially in the form of norms, can benefit both clinical practice and research. L. Fenson et al. (1994), for example, used the norming data from the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (CDIs) - a sample of 2,550 children aged 8 to 30 months - to address questions about variability in communicative development. Large samples are especially needed to provide an accurate statistical description of extreme scores, i.e., what score corresponds to the 10th percentile? What does the most advanced child (e.g., &gt; 90th percentile) look like at a given age? Research on questions such as environmental influences on language development can also benefit from large samples. Correlational research is hampered by the problem of multicollinearity: The predictor variables such as parental education, number of books in the home, family size, use of questions vs. imperatives, are likely to be intercorrelated, making it difficult to separate the effects of each of them individually. Large samples in which there is a substantial amount of non-overlapping variance are essential for addressing these questions. An additional advantage of the parent-report method is that parents can also report on many different sub-components and correlates of early vocabulary development. In particular, the CDI instruments ask about use of communicative gestures, grammar, and symbolic play, as well as vocabulary comprehension and production. Information about what early vocabulary development correlates with, and what it does not, can yield important theoretical information about the common mechanisms underlying learning. As Bates, Bretherton, and Snyder (1991) note, studies which have the power and scope to examine what “hangs together” across early language development can provide critical clues to how the system is put together in the first place (p. 7). The main core of the CDIs is the vocabulary checklist. This list is essentially a “bag of words” which represents the set of words that best capture variation in lexical development across the full spectrum of child ages and abilities. Parents choose the words their child currently “understands” (comprehension, measured for younger children) or “says” (production, measured for both younger and older children). A child’s score on a vocabulary checklist represents their comprehension or production “vocabulary size,” indexing that child’s relative status against other children assessed with the same list. The checklists contain words from many different semantic (e.g., animal names, household items) and syntactic (e.g., action words, connectives) categories, resulting in broader samples of lexical knowledge than are available from other methods. Importantly, however, these words are not chosen to create a complete list of words known by many child. Instead, CDI word lists are constructed to include a group of words that most children will know as well as a sampling of intermediate and more difficult words that will be useful in assessing variability between children. (We discuss the issue of “total vocabulary” further in Appendix F.) In their English and Spanish instantiations, the vocabulary checklists come in two versions: Words &amp; Gestures (W&amp;G) (8–18 months) which contains about 400 words, and the Words &amp; Sentences (W&amp;S) (16–30 months), which contains about 700 words. This structure has often been replicated across cross-linguistic adaptations, though there is some variation in form construction (see below), and some forms include substantially different numbers of words or include/exclude other measures. 1.3 Limitations of parent report Although the standardization of parent reports using the CDI contributes to the availability of large amounts of data in a comparable format, there are significant limitations to the parent report methodology as well (Tomasello and Mervis 1994, Feldman et al. (2000)). Clearly there are legitimate concerns about the ability of parents to provide detailed and specific knowledge about their children’s language. What does it mean when a parent reports that their child knows a word? In an ideal world, parental report would be an unbiased reflection of their observation of their child’s language development: When asked if their child produces the word dog, a parent would try to recall situations in which their child has used the word dog correctly, and report the success or failure of this process of recollection. There are, however, a number of other sources of information that the parent might bring to bear. The figure below uses graphical model notation to depict information that could be reflected in parent report (Jordan 2004). Figure 1.1: The statistical structure of parent report. Figure 1.2: The intuitive structure of parent report. The nodes in this model reflect variables of interest – shaded gray if they are observed, and hollow if they are latent variables that the parent does not have direct access. The edges in this graph represent statistical dependencies among these variables. For each word on the CDI, the parent is asked to report \\(O_{c}\\): have they observed their child producing the word? This observed variable depends on a latent variable \\(K_{c}\\): whether their child knows the meaning of this word. This knowledge in turn depends in three other variables: \\(O_{p}\\), the parent’s productions of this word in the past; \\(d\\), the difficulty of learning this word; and \\(\\mu_{c}\\), the child’s general linguistic ability. This general ability in turn depends on the parent’s linguistic ability \\(\\mu_{p}\\) and age-related factors \\(\\alpha_{c}\\). In addition, the CDI does not ask about every word in the child’s vocabulary, only items on the form \\(i\\). Because all of these other variables are statistically related to the child’s observed productions, parents could be be bringing any or all of them to bear in their responses. First, parents may be biased observers generally. Most parents do not have specialized training in language development, and may not be sensitive to subtle aspects of language structure and use. Further, a natural pride in the child and a failure to critically test their impressions may cause parents to overestimate the child’s ability (\\(\\mu_{c}\\)); conversely, frustration in the case of delayed language may lead to underestimates. Parent report is most likely to be accurate under three general conditions: (1) when assessment is limited to current behaviors, (2) when assessment is focused on emergent behaviors, and (3) when a primarily recognition format is used. Each of these conditions acts to reduce demands on the respondent’s memory, for example, parents are better able to report on their child’s language at the present than at times past and when their child is actively learning the particular words on the list (e.g., names for animals). Second, parent reports likely suffer from a number of biases that interact with sub-portions of the forms and the ages of the target children. For example, it is likely that parents may have more difficulty reporting on children’s comprehension or production of function words (e.g., so, then, if) than content words (e.g., baby, house)–relying more on their estimates of the words general difficulty (\\(d\\)). Moreover, in typically-developing samples, parents can track their child’s receptive vocabulary to about 16-18 months, after which it is too large to monitor. Expressive vocabulary can be monitored until about 2.5 - 3 years, after which the number of words a child can say becomes too large. The CDI instruments capitalize on the greater ease of recognition, as contrasted with recall, to help offset these memory limitations. That is, it is better to ask parents to report on their child’s vocabulary by selecting words from a list of possible words rather than having them write down all the words they can recall hearing their child use (or, even worse, asking the global question: “Does your child know at least 50 words?”). In addition, asking parents to reflect on their child’s language abilities may be particularly difficult for early comprehension. As Tomasello and Mervis (1994) point out, for the youngest children, especially 8 - 10 month olds, vocabulary comprehension scores can be surprisingly high and likely implausible, possibly reflecting a lack of clarity in what the term “understands” means for parents of children at this young age. Third, there is some evidence that variability in reporting biases may be moderated by factors such as SES (Feldman et al. 2000; L. Fenson et al. 2000; Feldman et al. 2005). Some studies suggest that parents from some SES groups may be more likely to underestimate child’s abilities (Roberts, Burchinal, and Durham 1999), while others report that parents from lower-SES groups may over-estimate children’s abilities, especially comprehension at younger ages [Goldfield and Reznick (1990); Feldman et al. (2000)). Later studies have shown that, for children over 2 years, patterns of validity were consistent in lower and higher-SES groups (Feldman et al. 2005; Reese and Read 2000). Thus, SES-differences could reflect valid delays in children’s language development that parallel those obtained with different methods, such as naturalistic observation or standardized tests (e.g., Hammer, Farkas, and Maczuga (2010)). A unique and important extension of this work for Wordbank is to examine the consistency of SES differences across a large number of languages and hence, language communities which may vary in the social impact of SES gradients. Fourth, as discussed above, the items on the original CDI instruments were chosen to be a representative sample of vocabulary for the appropriate age and language (L. Fenson et al. 1994). The checklists contain some words that most, including the youngest, children are able to understand or produce, some words that are understood or produced by the “average” child, and some which only children who are relatively more advanced will understand or produce. This structure ensures that the list has the psychometric property of capturing individual differences in vocabulary both across younger and older children and across children of different developmental levels. Validity of the CDIs has been demonstrated in reference to both standardized tests and naturalistic language sampling (see Chapter 4 of L. Fenson et al. (2007)). Note that the checklists were not originally constructed with the intention that responses on individual items would be reliable. While item level responses provide useful information about patterns across children are likely to understand or produce, responses on the vocabulary checklist do not necessarily license the conclusion that a child would respond appropriately when asked “can you say ____?” by an experimenter in a confrontation naming task. Nonetheless, if parents’ observations at the item level reflect any signal–even in the context of significant influence from other factors–then this signal should be observable by aggregating together data from many children. Fifth, while the lengths of the vocabulary checklists on the CDIs may give the impression that they yield an estimate of the child’s full vocabulary, in fact the vocabulary size estimates only reflect a child’s relative standing compared to other children assessed with the same list of words(\\(i\\), see Mayor and Plunkett 2011 for discussion). Such estimates should not be misconstrued as a comprehensive estimate of the child’s vocabulary knowledge, as CDI scores likely understate the size of a child’s “true” vocabulary substantially, especially for older children (Mayor and Plunkett 2011). Moreover, while it is tempting to ask parents to indicate additional words that their child might be able to understand or say, users should be aware that including those items introduces bias in the estimates. Finally, when a parent reports on a word on the vocabulary checklist, there is no information about the actual form of the word used, and hence, these vocabulary estimates can say little about phonological development (e.g. segmental v. suprasegmental approaches to the analysis of speech). Parents are instructed that they should check that a child can produce a word even if it is pronounced in the child’s “special way,” and only approximates the adult form. We also gain little information about the frequency with which children use a particular word in their spontaneous speech, nor can we know the range of contexts in which individual lexical items are used (e.g., is that word used productively vs. in a memorized chunk of speech). In sum, despite these limitations, when used appropriately, the CDI instruments yield reliable and valid estimates of total vocabulary size. Because the instruments were designed to minimize bias by targeting current behaviors and asking parents about highly salient features of their child’s abilities, they have proven to be an important tool in the field, dozens of studies demonstrating concurrent and predictive relations with naturalistic and observational measures, in both typically-developing and at-risk populations (e.g., Dale and Fenson 1996; Thal, Jackson-Maldonado, and Acosta 2000; Marchman and Martínez-Sussmann 2002). In addition, a variety of recent work has shown that individual item-level responses can yield exciting new insights, for example about the growth patterns of semantic networks when aggregated across children (Hills et al. 2009; Hills et al. 2010). Such analyses have the potential to be even more powerful when applied to larger samples and across languages as they are within Wordbank. 1.4 Cross-linguistic comparison 1.4.1 Adaptation, not translation! Originally designed for English, parallel CDI instruments have now been adapted for more than 90 languages (http://mb-cdi.stanford.edu/adaptations.html), with data from 28 of those languages currently available in Wordbank (Dale and Penfold 2011). The ethic behind the development of these instruments is “adaptation, not translation” – in other words, create forms with the same spirit as the English form, but do not simply translate the items (Dale 2015). Instead, developers have been strongly encouraged to craft instruments that reflect the linguistic and cultural contexts that influence the early acquisition of vocabulary and other aspects of language in that particular language. The resulting forms vary widely, including differences in length and intended age range. Some forms include hundreds of items more than the original 680 words on the English Words &amp; Sentences form; others are so-called “short forms” and include only a hundred or a few hundred carefully selected words. Some are designed to capture development from the emergence of language through ages 3–4 years, while others are focused on very early development (like the English Words &amp; Gestures form, designed for ages 8–18 months). While many words on the English-language checklist may easily translate to other languages, others will simply not be relevant within the same developmental time frame for children learning that new language, e.g., cheese in Japanese or snow in Arabic. Conversely, additional words may be needed in the new language which were not included on the English-language vocabulary checklist, e.g., tortilla in Mexican Spanish. In all languages, though, the vocabulary checklists include words that appear earlier and later in normal development, as well as a similar proportion of words from different lexical classes, for example, nouns, verbs, adjectives, and so on. Taken individually then, each adapted instrument captures key trends in vocabulary development aggregated across all items on the respective checklists. Further, due to variation in language structure and the interests of the developers of CDI adaptations, the CDI instruments vary in structure across languages. Most adaptations of the W&amp;G generally include gestures as well as vocabulary comprehension and production, however, it is not always the case. Further, while adaptations of the W&amp;S always include vocabulary production, not all instruments also contain some measures of grammar, for example, early use of closed-class morphology or combinatorial syntax. Note that linguistic differences render the structure and format of many parts of the grammar sections to be very different, and hence, not amenable to comparisons across languages. A few instruments included in our dataset are pure checklists, with no other sections included. In sum, CDIs are a useful tool for many languages, but the forms differ between languages. 1.4.2 Our approach The wide cross-linguistic adoption of the CDI provides an opportunity for cross-linguistic comparison but it also creates many challenges that are not present in datasets that are designed from the start for such comparions. Differences in instruments and items as well as differences in samples and administration conditions all make it potentially quite problematic to compare scores and score distributions across forms. We discuss differences in instruments and items here and defer discussion of differences in samples and administration to Chapter 3. Obviously differences in length between CDI forms mean that comparisons of raw scores across instruments are inappropriate. Dividing raw scores by the total number of items on a form results in proportions, which are somewhat more comparable but still potentially misleading. A more comprehensive form with more items on it will yield lower proportions for children with the same vocabulary size. Despite this weakness, we typically use proportions for visualizing differences across forms as it is cumbersome to compare raw scores with different totals. More discussion of absolute and relative vocabulary size differences between instruments can be found in Chapter 4. Like other psychometric instruments, CDI instruments can also be normed, and many of the most popular forms are. In the standard norming process, the form is administered to a large typically-developing sample so that percentile ranks can be computed. For new administrations, the percentile of a particular raw score can be computed and used in place of the proportions or raw scores. These percentile ranks can be useful for clinical purposes, but they also complicate comparison across instruments because of potential differences in the norming population to begin with. In addition, the Wordbank dataset includes normed and un-normed forms, and for the normed forms, we sometimes have access to both the norming dataset and other data but sometimes only have access to the norming data. For these reasons, we do not employ normative percentile ranks in our analyses. As the preceding discussion shows, there are serious difficulties that crop up immediately in comparisons across instruments. We will grapple with these difficulties throughout the book, but we generally adopt two approaches that help us navigate this complexity. The first approach, which is used in the majority of chapters, we describe below. The second approach is described in the next subsection. In general, our approach to cross-linguistic and cross-instrument data is to provide standardized analyses within each instrument and language, without assuming equivalence across words, instruments, or populations. Thus, we will typically investigate a particular phenomenon (say the “noun bias” or the “female advantage”) independently and in parallel for each of the instruments available to us.3 We can then – still with caution – analyze and compare the magnitude of this phenomenon across languages, having abstracted away from the specifics of each particular instrument. We sometimes colloquially refer to this approach as “every form an island,” meaning that each instrument is analyzed separately and only the analytic results at the highest level are compared. Cross-linguistic conceptual comparisons are fraught, both philosophically (e.g., Quine 1960) and practically. We refer to the practical issue as the tortilla problem: in American English, we have the word bread, which translates to pan in Mexican Spanish. But the Spanish word tortilla takes some of the cultural role of bread in English; bread has two reasonable translations. These translation issues go the other way as well: reloj translates to two distinct words (clock and watch) in English. For this reason, we typically adopt the “every form an island” approach described above. But questions nevertheless arise in the course of analyzing CDI data that can only be answered by comparison across languages (see e.g., Chapter 11). Thus, in order to facilitate (cautious) cross-linguistic comparison, we developed a set of rough-and-ready translation equivalents. We call these “unilemmas” (short for “universal lemmas”). A “lemma” is a canonical form of a word, typically used for gathering frequency counts across different morphological variants (e.g., walk is the lemma for walks, walked, and walking). Unilemmas are used for mapping distinct lexical forms across languages. Unilemmas enable a number of desirable analyses, but more practically, they also provide consistent glosses that make it easier for researchers to work in languages with which they are not familiar. For convenience, our unilemmas are written in English, but they could of course have been written in any other language as well. Further details on the unilemmas are given in Chapter 3. Even with the care we used here to construct a robust set translation equivalents, individual items are likely to only be roughly equivalent cross-linguistically, and may have significantly different referential scopes for children learning the different languages. That is, if a parent indicates that a child can produce the word dog in English and another parent indicates the translation equivalent in, for example, Spanish (perro), it may nevertheless be the case that these words are heard more or less frequently and in different contexts in the two languages. An important empirical question is the degree to which translation equivalents across languages have consistent developmental profiles. 1.5 Our data: Wordbank To take advantage of the opportunity posed by the broad use of CDI instruments in the child language community, in 2014 we began constructing Wordbank, an open repository for CDI data that allows for interactive analysis and visualization. Our inspiration for Wordbank came from two successful projects for sharing data on children’s language acquisition. The first is the Child Language Data Exchange System (CHILDES; MacWhinney 2000). A database of transcripts of children’s speech and speech to children, CHILDES has grown into a robust and important tool for the community, with many contributors and affiliated projects. The second is the Cross-Linguistic Lexical Norms site (CLEX; R. N. Jørgensen et al. 2010), which is closer in content to Wordbank, and effectively our precursor. CLEX archived normative data from a range of CDI adaptations across languages, allowing browsing of acquisition trajectories for individual items or age groups. Wordbank initially built on CLEX, offering the same functionality but allowing flexible and interactive visualization and analysis, as well as direct database access and data download. In addition, Wordbank’s goal was always to extend beyond normative data by dynamically incorporating data from many different researchers and projects of varying sizes and scopes. While the resulting datasets in Wordbank are much more heterogeneous than norming data, they are also larger and more representative than the individual norming datasets (in some cases), and available in languages where no norms exist (for others). While there are inherent limitations in comparing different instruments across languages – limitations that we return to again and again throughout the book – our dataset is the first that allows the exploration of both child- and item-level data within- and across such a large and diverse set of languages. As such, the availability of these adaptations remain at the core of the analyses that we offer within Wordbank. We began the Wordbank project – our first large-scale, data-aggregation project – with a relatively naive attitude. We thought “if you build it, they will come”: that contributors would flock to the opportunity to share their data with the world. We were unprepared for the challenges of contacting academics around the world, asking them to volunteer their time and hard-won data to an unknown cause, and then understanding the myriad formats and conventions represented in the data we eventually received. For the first couple of years, our data were largely co-extensive with those gathered by CLEX. Fortunately, in the years since the Wordbank project began, attitudes towards data sharing have been shifting rapidly (in part as a result of work on replication and reproducibility, e.g. Collaboration and others 2015). In addition, the credibility of the Wordbank project has gradually grown, in part due to the support of the MacArthur-Bates CDI advisory board. And as we received successively more data, our expertise in dealing with heterogeneous datasets has grown. Thus, the dataset has grown quickly in recent years. We hope that in future, authors see contribution to Wordbank as an aspirational endpoint for future studies using CDI instruments. Some material in this chapter comes from M. C. Frank et al. (2016) and Marchman and Dale (2017).↩ An exception to this approach is that we do sometimes interpolate words’ trajectories across matched instruments for the same language, e.g. the proportion of children who say the word “cat” on both Words and Gestures and Words and Sentences forms for American English; see Appendix D.↩ "],
["theory-intro.html", "2 Theoretical Foundations 2.1 Process Universals", " 2 Theoretical Foundations THEORY CHAPTER VERY FRAGMENTARY As we noted in the introduction, observing what “hangs together” in development can provide clues to the underlying system (???). We think of these correlations as loose targets for theorists: a successful theory can gain support by providing an account for these observations. But what kinds of theories can these observations differentiate? Figure 2.1: A caricature of the traditional theoretical space in langauge acquisition research. BORNSTEIN QUOTE Weaker claim - the same variability is there across cultures/languages. DEMOGRAPHIC EXAMPLE - SES is variable, gender is consistent Relationship between size and variability should be informative A call to action to care about size and variability Measurement 2.1 Process Universals NEW AXIS FIGURE VARIABLE CONSISTENT &lt;—————————————&gt; SES / NOUN BIAS GRAMMAR/LEX COV GENDER CULTURE/LANGUAGE COGNITION What is the nature of these putatitive universals? By virtue of the learning problem that they arise from, they cannot be universals of content. A child’s vocabulary is made up of individual words, each arising from a set of specific interactional circumstances (e.g., the trip to the zoo where a giraffe was seen for the first time). And each of these words is – of course – specific to a particular language. Thus, there is no viable sense in which any possible universals for vocabulary learning can be content universals: no particular content of this type could be innately given. For this reason, we describe these as “process” universals: they relate to the process by which each individual extracts a lexicon from their own idiosyncratic linguistic experiences. To examine whether there is content to the claim of process universals, it is helpful to consider the alternative hypothesis. One alternative is that the process of language acquisition is specific and particular, rather than universal. Two prominent particulars pull against universal tendencies. The first is the vast semantic and syntactic variation across the world’s languages. For example, as illustrated by (???) and others, languages vary dramatically in the ways that they assign semantic content to verbs. If the semantic partition of verbs led to large-scale differences in the timeline or mechanism of acquisition, we might see systematic differences in the predictors of age of acquisition for verbs in these languages, yet we do not. Further, languages are more and less morphologically complex; while the most morphologically-complex, polysynthetic languages are not represented in Wordbank, we do have data from both Mandarin (less complex) and Russian (more complex). If morphosyntax were relatively more or less important in the acquisition of particular languages, we might expect radical differences in the noun bias, the grammar-lexicon correlation, or the predictors of age of acquisition across languages, yet we do not observe these. Of course, there is always room for finer-grained predictions – with more detailed predictive models and better typological coverage, perhaps we will discover such signatures. Our point here is merely that neither morphosyntactic nor semantic variability across languages dominates the process of vocabulary acquisition. The second set of language-specific particulars that might lead to variance across languages is the vast cultural variability across the communities represented in the Wordbank data. With N continents represented, we see both “individualist” and “collectivist” cultures (???,(???)) as well as both “loose fit” and “tight fit” cultures (???). To the extent that parenting differs across these – and there is good evidence that it does [CITES] – we should see variance in the trajectory of language learning. For example, as mentioned previously, it would be quite reasonable to predict that the female advantage in vocabulary acquisition might vary as a function of cross-national gender biases (Nosek et al. 2009). Yet it is strikingly consistent overall, again arguing that – at the broadest level, at least – cultural factors do not dominate other child-internal processes in the acquisition of vocabulary. QUANTITATIVE PREDICTIONS: if language moves your signature mean then you are a particular, not a universal - SES - noun bias Claims of universals should always be taken with a grain of salt. In our case, a variety of caveats apply, from the relatively limited sample size N = 28 (see Piantadosi and Gibson 2014 for guidance on claims about strict universals) to the strong Indo-European bias amongst the languages in the database. At best our claim is of a statistical universal rather than an absolute universal. In addition, nearly all of our data come from populations in relatively industrialized nations (cf. Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan 2010). FURTHER CAVEATS 2.1.1 What is a Process?

["methods.html", "3 Methods and Data4 3.1 Database 3.2 Datasets", " 3 Methods and Data4 We begin by introducing the structure of our dataset and the database that contains it. In the second section, we give some descriptive information on the datasets included in the database. 3.1 Database Why use a database to store vocabulary data? Consider the standard format of raw CDI data. Here is a small slice of the original CDI norming data (L. Fenson et al. 1994; L. Fenson et al. 2007). Each row is a child, each column gives a variable – either a demographic variable or the result of a particular word being administered to a particular child. Although this format is useful for homogeneous administrations of a single instrument, it cannot accommodate multiple instruments, multiple languages, or datasets with different sources or kinds of demographic information. Consolidating data across different instruments is very difficult in this format, and tracking data on children with multiple longitudinal administrations of a single instrument must also be done in an ad-hoc manner. The move to a database format allows far more flexible and programmatic handling of heterogeneous data structures from different sources. Further, as information about particular entities becomes available – for example, cross-linguistic mappings of lexical items – this information can be added in a way that preserves previous analyses. In a tabular format, such functionality is not guaranteed, and changes to the structure of the dataset will necessarily break previous analyses. A database, especially when supplemented with an appropriate application programming interface (API, see below), can solve this problem elegantly. 3.1.1 Database Architecture A relational database such as Wordbank is at its heart an ontology: a set of entities that are described in a series of tables linked by unique identifiers. The primary entities in the Wordbank database are: Instrument: A specific parent-report survey or questionnaire with a particular set of items. For example, the American English Words and Sentences form is an individual instrument. Item: A particular question on an instrument. A specific word like dog is our canonical CDI item, but other items include questions about gestures, morphological and syntactic complexity, and other aspects of early language or behavior. Administration: A particular instance of an instrument being given to a child, with an associated child age and source (the contributing lab). Child: A unique individual, with associated demographics. Language: A particular language or language community for which a CDI instrument has been adapted. Note that this definition of language distinguishes e.g. American and British English. These entities are related by two primary groups of tables in Wordbank. The common tables store data that is shared between CDI instruments, including information about administrations (individual instances of a form being filled out for a child), and items (words and other questions on a form). Then the instrument tables store the item-by-item response data for particular CDI instruments. We currently include all items on CDI instruments, including questions about communication, gesture, morphology, and grammar (though in quite a few of the datasets that we archive these non-vocabulary questions have not been digitized so data on these are sparse at present; see e.g., Chapters 13 and 14). Wordbank is designed so that it can accommodate data from a wide variety of instruments, both within and across languages. Indeed, at the time of rendering, the site includes data from more than 78787 administrations of the CDI across 28 different languages and 54 different instruments. 3.1.2 Implementation Wordbank is constructed using free, open-source tools. The database is a standard MySQL database, managed using Python and Django.All code for Wordbank is hosted in GitHub repositories, with the primary site repository containing data and database code, the r package repository containing code for the API, and the book repository containing the code and text for this manuscript. All data uploaded to Wordbank are open and freely available for download, both through the site itself and through the GitHub repository. The site includes only de-identified data that cannot be linked to individual parents and children under US Department of Health and Human Services’ “Safe Harbor” standard. Because of these features, the Stanford Institutional Review Board has determined that the Wordbank project does not constitute human subjects research. 3.1.3 The wordbankr API An application programming interface (API) is a set of abstractions that allow applications to interact with a resource (e.g., a set of data like Wordbank) through consistent abstractions. Although in principle it is possible to construct raw SQL queries to Wordbank, in practice all access is through an R API that constructs individual SQL calls. This API is distributed to R users through the wordbankr package, which is available through the Comprehensive R Network (CRAN). We developed this package, wordbankr, to provide a simple and flexible API for the Wordbank dataset (M. C. Frank et al. 2016), and our current book depends on it heavily. The package provides a consistent set of function calls for retrieving data from the underlying database, for example get_instruments or get_administrations to retrieve all or subsections of these tables, respectively. We do not describe the package in depth here, since it is described in our previous paper and in its online documentation 3.1.4 “Unilemmas”: cross-linguistic conceptual mappings As described in Chapter 1, it is sometimes useful to (cautiously) compare the developmental trajectory for a single concept across multiple languages. To facilitate these comparisons, we created “unilemmas,” cross-linguistic mappings from lexical items to single (English) forms that stand for a particular conceptual abstraction. Some lexical items are represented on only one or a handful of instruments, but there are many that are common across a large number of instruments, leading to an opportunity for cross-linguistic comparison. Unilemmas were created for particular instruments by following a two-step procedure. First, using a pool of English unilemmas, we proposed candidate mappings for each lexical item on a form. This first step was often accomplished by a non-native speaker using translation resources and the context of the form (e.g., that an item occurs in the “animal sounds” section). Second, we recruited a linguistically-sophisticated native speaker of the language (often a psychologist or linguist), provided them with the candidate unilemma list, and asked them to review this list item by item and suggest corrections and amendments.5 Not every instrument has unilemma mappings, but they are currently available for FIXME forms in FIXME languages. 3.1.5 A note on age Developmental psychologists are very fond of using temporal units like months and years as rough guides. Children tend to begin to crawl between 5 and 8 months, and say their first word around one year. This practice is fine for rules of thumb, but we also use these units for measurement as though they were precise (e.g., “infants with ages between 7;0 and 8;0”) when in fact such infants will vary in the number of days since their birth depending on facts like whether their seven months of life encompassed February or not. A similar problem is true of years as a scientific unit – because of leap years, years technically include 365.2524 days — though the magnitude of the imprecision is smaller. Despite these issues, months are the currency of language development research, and we often receive contributed datasets with months as the only measure of age. In Wordbank, we define a standardized month as 365.2524 / 12 = 30.4377 days. When possible, we compute the number of days from birth to testing and then compute the number of standardized months that the child has lived. If this is not possible, we use months as reported in the dataset. We define an eight-month-old (age == 8) as a child who has lived between 8 and 9 standard months: their age is in the range [8 - 9) standard months. (The alternative definition, from 7;16 – 8;15, is sometimes used in infancy research but is in our opinion less intuitive.) 3.2 Datasets This section gives a broad overview of the data we have available. Unlike projects in which data are collected by the organizers, in our work here, we rely on the kindness of others in contributing data that are often years or decades old. Some datasets come via an email containing well-curated tabular data; others were contributed in more idiosyncratic formats or even on paper. One dataset was even retrieved by one of us from a doorstep several hours drive away, in the form of a paper bag full of old paper forms. Thus, the amount and type of meta-data available for some datasets is limited. For example, we have limited demographic information for some datasets and only vocabulary – not complexity or gesture – items for others. In many cases we do not have full details of instructions and administration for a particular dataset. This section gives an overview of data availability and some demographic comparisons of the samples. Specifics of each dataset – to the extent that they are available – are given in Appendix A. 3.2.1 Data Provenance As mentioned above, datasets come from a variety of sources. In all cases, the preferred citation for each dataset and its contributor is given on the Wordbank contributors page. Several of these datasets were transferred second-hand from a pre-existing database (CLEX-CDI; R. N. Jørgensen et al. 2010), while many of the others were contributed directly via electronic or paper forms. In the case of paper forms, we re-keyed the forms using double-entry methods (either ourselves or via a commercial contractor).6 Each of these datasets is then imported to the database by creating a custom import key that matches individual columns of the dataset to particular database fields (e.g., item types like words or gestures, or standardized demographic fields). These mappings are preserved along with the raw data so that they can be re-checked later. 3.2.2 Overview of the data Wordbank currently contains data from 28 language communities. Many of these are from instruments in the original Words &amp; Gestures (infant) / Words &amp; Sentences (toddler) format, with around 400 items in WG and 700 in the WS. Typically, WG forms are intended for children from 8–18 months and WS forms are intended for children 16–30 months, but these ranges are flexible. Some WS forms are used up to 36 months or extended as low as 12 months (in cases where a single form is considered desirable by the researchers constructing the adaptation). The table below gives an overview of the available instruments in the dataset. Wordbank also includes some other forms that do not fit into this schema, including short forms and vocabulary questionnaires. Some of these are “short forms” with no internal category structure and fewer items overall, and these are excluded from many item and category analyses. But others have many structural features of WS and WG forms. For example, the Oxford CDI is a WG-style form with comprehension as well as production estimates, but applied to a larger age-range. The Mandarin Infant Checklist (IC) and Toddler Checklist (TC) are checklist forms without grammatical and gesture items but with structured sets of vocabulary items. We include these forms in analyses where WS and WG data are included. The number of administrations available is highly variable across instruments and languages, however. 3.2.3 Administration details Data in the dataset were gathered between the beginning of the first CDI norming study in 1990 and the present, with the majority of datasets gathered within the 10–15 years prior to the writing of this book. The details of administration vary widely from dataset to dataset. Though we have different levels of knowledge regarding the exact details of administration, we know that the three most common circumstances of administration (in no particular order) are: On paper in a lab or other space, with instructions given in person by a researcher (e.g., L. Fenson et al. 1994); On paper, with the form sent by mail with written or telephone instructions from a researcher (e.g., the British English Twins Early Development data, which were sent home as part of a packet; ???); or Electronically, with instructions given either electronically or by phone (e.g., Kristoffersen et al. 2013). We have limited direct evidence about the effects of particular administration details on the overall results. Such evidence would require random assignment of parents to administration method rather than, e.g., a comparison of administration methods across different populations in which there are obvious sample-related confounds. Nevertheless, the CDI community has amassed a substantial set of anecdotal experiences. For example, improper administration or limited instructions can result in over- or under-reporting, especially with respect to comprehension (see e.g., Feldman et al. 2000). In one trial we conducted using electronic administration, we found that basic written instructions were misinterpreted by some proportion of parents (as evinced by an atypical number of floor and ceiling responses). This proportion appeared to decrease when we made an attempt to simplify and illustrate the instructions that we gave. Such experiences suggest – congruent with the general warnings above – that caution is warranted in interpreting absolute comparisons between different populations where there are also differences in administration style. 3.2.4 Demographics In addition to differences in administration and form, samples from different studies also differ in myriad other ways. The most important of these, especially cultural differences between language communities, are extremely hard to quantify. But we can make a first stab at investigating some similarities and differences between the convenience samples from different studies by comparing demographics where they are available. Sex proportions tend to be quite close to .5, with a few exceptions for small datasets. Several WG datasets (e.g., British Sign Language, Russian, Italian, Quebec French) have more males than would be expected by chance. This pattern is important because (as we will investigate in Chapter 3.2.4), there are systematic differences in vocabulary size between boys and girls, and so sample differences in gender will lead to absolute differences in mean vocabulary size. Although we have maternal education data for far fewer datasets, there are also substantial differences between datasets on this variable (we will also return to this issue again in Chapter 3.2.4). Analyses of this variable are complicated by different reporting formats, so for example the German and Mexican Spanish datasets have no separate categorization for graduate education. That said, even for datasets with the most fine-grained maternal education breakdown, we see substantial differences. Finally, when we examine birth order, we also see differences in the proportion of children who are first- vs. later-born. The majority of the German sample is first-born, while the Czech sample has many more second children, for example. In summary, our samples differ substantially in their demographic makeup. Presumably these differences are due both to the composition of the societies being sampled as well as the sampling procedure the researchers used. 3.2.5 Longitudinal vs. cross-sectional data The strongest developmental inferences can be made by the examination of longitudinal data, in which children’s individual development is measured multiple times using the same instrument. Unfortunately, relatively little of our CDI data comes from this type of repeated administration. For normative datasets, pure cross-sectional data collection is used to ensure statistical independence between datapoints; for this reason much of our data are cross-sectional. Thus, we must typically settle for using the large amount of available cross-sectional data to average out individual variability. We do use the extensive Norwegian longitudinal data in Chapter 15, however. 3.2.6 Conclusions The strength of the Wordbank framework is that it allow access to CDI data in a consistent format, such that analyses can be applied uniformly. Yet we must not allow this ease to blind us to the difficulties of comparing across measurements that are gathered using different forms, under different administration conditions, and from convenience samples in different countries and cultures using different sampling schemes. Each of these differences has the potential to complicate cross-linguistic comparisons. We will return to each throughout the book. Some material in this chapter is adapted from M. C. Frank et al. (2016).↩ The specific direction they were given was: “We’re looking for the best English translation of these words. These are words that are among the first words that children learn, so your translation should be closest to the meaning of the word as it would be used by a young child (say, under 3 years old). For cases when there are two equally good English words, put both. If you don’t think there is a good translation into a reasonable English word that a kid might know, you can leave the alternative translation blank.”↩ In a check for errors in the re-keying of one Korean dataset, we found that there were 4 incorrect fields in 10 full records for an error rate of ~0.06%.↩ "],
["vocab.html", "4 Vocabulary Development 4.1 Central Tendencies 4.2 Variability between individuals", " 4 Vocabulary Development Far from simply reflecting noise in our measuring instruments or variability in low-level aspects of physiological maturation, the variations that we will document (in vocabulary development) are substantial, stable, and have their own developmental course. Because this variation is substantial, it is critical for defining the boundary between normal and abnormal development; because it is stable, it provides a window onto the correlates and (by inference) the causes of developmental change; and because it has its own developmental course, it can be used to pinpoint critical developmental transitions that form the basis for theories of learning and change. (Bates et al., 1995) This chapter focuses on one canonical view of CDI data, in which each child is represented by a single vocabulary score: the proportion of words that child knows, out of the total in the form. (We discuss why we use raw score, as opposed to other measures, in C). We begin by quantifying the median pattern of vocabulary growth observed in our data; we then turn to characterizing variability across individuals in these data. This chapter trades in variability, but variability is only meaningful in the case that it is stable; that is, that it reflects signal about individuals (or cultures) rather than measurement error. With respect to the CDI, the strong evidence for the reliability and validity of the forms – reviewed in Chapter 1 and in L. Fenson et al. (2007) – provides support for the contention that observed variability is meaningful. Such evidence has primarily been collected for the English CDI, however. In this chapter we examine variability across the full set of languages, and it is worth noting up front that we project the reliability and validity of the English instrument to its adaptations. One study nicely illustrates why such an approach might not be misguided. Bornstein and Putnick (2012) collected multiple language measures at 20 and 48 months in a sample of nearly 200 children and used a structural equation model to estimate the stability of a single latent construct, language ability. Essentially all measures related strongly to this latent variable and the coefficient on its stability over time was \\(r = .84\\), suggesting that early language is quite stable, at least when measured appropriately. Notably, the ELI, a precursor to the CDI, was included in the measures at 20 months and was found to correlate with the 20-month latent construct at \\(r = .87\\). This finding – along with the other evidence, mentioned above – justifies the implicit conceptual model of the following analyses. That model is that there is a single quantity, early language ability, that is stably measured by parent report and that can be approximated as the raw proportion of words “understood” or “said and understood” on CDI forms. 4.1 Central Tendencies One first question we can ask about CDI data is about its central tendency – the median pattern of vocabulary growth. Our general expectation is shown below. Figure 4.1: Schematic true vocabulary growth and vocbaulary growth as measured by the CDI. This image reveals a number of patterns that are explored in this and subsequent chapters. The CDI necessarily captures a small fraction of any individual’s true vocabulary, but even within this range there are specific questions that are usefully addressed. The question of the exact slope of children’s growth, especially in the period immediately after the emergence of language, is treated in Chapter ?? – this question is sometimes posed as whether children undergo a vocabulary “spurt” (Ganger and Brent 2004). On the other side of the CDI curve, the question of the divergence between CDI-measured vocabulary and true vocabulary (and whether true vocabulary can be recovered via a statistical correction) is treated in Appendix F. In the current chapter, we focus on the middle section of the CDI curve, in which children’s vocabulary is neither at the floor or the ceiling of the instrument. 4.1.1 Commonalities across languages Figure 4.2: Median production using the Words and Sentences form. Included are only lanugages where there are more than 200 administrations total. Plotted above are the median patterns of growth for early production. Rather than showing proportions, as we will do more standardly throughout the book, here individual item totals are plotted.7 In general, the median child before the first birthday is reported to produce a small number of words. (These data raise a number of questions about the specific reliability of very early parent reports, which we take up below.) Overall, however, these curves accord relatively well with our intuitive sense of early vocabulary development: they reveal that children before their first birthday tend to speak at most only a few words, but that production accelerates across the second year. This acceleration is even clearer when looking at production reports from older children using Words and Sentences. In every language, we see the median child is reported to produce 50 words between 16 and 20 months. As we will see below, this analysis masks the tremendous variability apparent during this period. In addition, as we discuss below, languages vary considerably in the absolute number of words reported. (We discuss Mandarin in particular, which is a major outlier from other languages in this analysis). Nevertheless, there are still substantial consistencies between languages. During the period 24-30 months, we see children beginning to produce a large enough sample of words that curves are leveling out. Presumably this leveling does not reflect a slowing in the rate of acquisition, which many authors assume continues unabated for many years (L. Bloom, Tinker, and Scholnick 2001). Instead, it reflects the limitations of the CDI instrument, in that there are many possible “more advanced” words that they could be learning, of which only a small subset are represented on any form. (See Appendix @ref{appendix-vocab-estimation) for estimates of how many words children actually might know.) We next turn to comprehension. Comprehension is only queried on the Words and Gestures form. Reported comprehension increases much faster than production; so much so that most parents are reporting that their children understand most words on the form by 18 months. See Chapter 15 for discussion of the differences in the balance between comprehension and production between children. As with the production data, we see substantial differences across languages in reported vocabulary (see below). One striking aspect of comprehension data is how early comprehension is reported. For example, from 8 months, we see parents reporting medians of 4.5 (Swedish) and 41 (Russian) words. Intuitively, to many researchers (and parents) these high numbers feel unlikely. A spate of recent infancy experiments suggest that in fact, children in the second half of the first year do have some fragmentary representations of many common words available (e.g., ???, Bergelson and Swingley (2012), Bergelson and Aslin (2017)). The representations revealed in these tasks are quite weak – often amounting to a 2-5% difference in looking to a target on hearing a word uttered – but, depending on the criterion used by parents, may be what is detected in these early reports. Thus, these estimates may not be as far off as we initially suppose.8 4.1.2 Cross-language differences What causes the differences between languages observed above? In this discussion, we examine production on the Words and Sentences form, as the data are the densest and most reliable for this instrument. We first discuss the case of Mandarin. Mandarin WS data are reported by Tardif et al. (2009) in a study of both Mandarin- and Cantonese-learning children. They also show the pronounced Mandarin advantage plotted above. They investigate possible explanations, given that the administration and sampling procedures were similar in these two languages. The children in the Mandarin sample are nearly all monolingual, only children; but these factors did not account for variation between samples, and so Tardif et al. (2009) speculate that structural factors regarding Mandarin (e.g., phonological structure relative to Cantonese). These speculations seem unlikely in light of the data presented here. First, the same trajectory is not shown in the data from the toddler questionnaire of Hao et al. (2008). Second, this unusual trajectory is not apparent in the Mandarin WG data shown above. Finally, given the surprising difference between Mandarin and all other languages in the sample, pure phonological factors seem unlikely to account fully for the differences. These differences thus remain somewhat mysterious – and serve as an important caution against simple cross-linguistic comparison in raw scores. In the remainder of this section, we consider the other languages in the WS sample. The figure above shows estimates of the median 24-month vocabulary in both raw scores and proportions. (To increase stability, the plotted value is the intercept of a linear model predicting vocabulary as a function of centered age between 18 and 30 months). Clearly there are substantial differences in raw scores. We consider a range of explanations for this pattern. Differences could be due to differences in form length. As shown in the plot above, medians for production and raw scores are highly correlated (\\(r\\)(15) = 0.654, \\(p\\) = 0.00442), suggesting that this ordering is not only a function of form length. Further, although raw scores are correlated with form length (\\(r\\)(15) = 0.376, \\(p\\) = 0.137), this correlation changes direction and is no longer reliable for proportions (\\(r\\)(15) = -0.451, \\(p\\) = 0.0693). In sum, it appears that there are form-length differences (motivating the use of proportions in general), but that there is still stratification between languages even correcting for this issue. See below for a plot of the relevant proportion trajectories, highlighting remaining differences between English and Danish (two languages for which we have substantial datasets with full demographic information). Differences could be due to form construction. For example, the Czech form could contain harder words, leading to fewer words being checked. We cannot directly address questions about the difficulty distribution items without moving to psychometric models, which carry their own risks (see Appendix C). Further, even latent ability scores (estimated via item response theory) will not be comparable across instruments unless items are assumed to be shared across instruments (which they are not, since dog in English need not be equally easy as perro in Spanish). Thus, assessing form difficulty across languages is a complex proposition. Differences could be due to demographic differences across samples. We can examine sample composition in Chapter 3 and see that – to the extent we have access to demographic data – sample composition does vary in features that affect vocabulary (e.g., maternal education, birth order; see Chapter 3.2.4). We are not yet in a position to conduct a full analysis of these differences, controlling for demographics, as data are sparse and demographic differences also vary across cultures. But we can examine the difference between Danish, and English (American) for example, and note that these differences look quite similar (though noisier) in the female, first-born children of college-educated mothers. Thus, we do not believe that demographic differences fully explain the cross-linguistic differences observed. Differences could be due to cohort effects, in which older sets of data show differences from newer datasets. Most of our data date to the period 2005-2015, but some of the English and Spanish data are older. It’s not clear that there is an obvious trend, though, as the Danish data for example are relatively recent and were collected online using standardized instructions. Differences may relate not to demographics of the sample but to the administration, and these we cannot control for statistically. For example, instructions at administration – whether written on the form or given by experimenters – might have been more liberal in the case of Slovak or English (American) samples. Such instructions could have emphasized completeness in reporting vocabulary. Or the circumstances of administration could have been different – for example, Danish data were collected online while most English data were collected using paper and pencil forms. English (American) data are contributed by many different labs, so there are likely many different administration styles represented. Differences could be due to cultural or experimental differences in reporting bias. Slovak parents might have a lower criterion for reporting knowledge of a word. Recalling our discussion of these issues in Chapter 6.1, their model of children’s overall competence might be shifted up. (Such an explanation could be true in principle for the case of the Mandarin data discussed above, as well, though this would be a case of extreme differences!). This explanation is as an extension of the discussion above of administration and instructions – perhaps cultural expectations for what it means to be producing a word or cultural expectations for how verbal children are expected to be. Finally, differences could be due to true differences in language acquisition. Many researchers working on Danish believe that, due to its phonological properties (MORE HERE), it is truly a difficult language to learn ((???)). In summary, differences between languages in the sheer number of words reported are unlikely to be accounted for purely by differences in form size or demographic differences between samples. In our view they likely result from a combination of cultural attitudes towards children’s language, differences in administration instructions, and real differences in learning across languages. Partialling out these differences would likely require better-controlled data that included constant administration and sampling methods. For this reason, we attempt to avoid interpreting overall differences in vocabulary size wherever possible and limit ourselves to quantities that can be effectively normalized. 200), --> % --> % --> 200), --> 4.2 Variability between individuals We next turn from the question of central tendencies to the question of variability. One of the most important features of early vocabulary development is its variability (L. Fenson et al. 1994). To examine variability, we switch to a view of the data that reveals the full range of variation across the samples in the database. Examining Words and Sentences data, we can see that across every language in the database there is a tremendous range of vocabulary sizes reported. How systematic is this variability?9 As an example, we zoom in on the English (American) production data from Words and Sentences form. Consider just a single age group, 24-month-olds. The distribution of vocabularies across children is far from normally distributed, with many children at the very bottom of the scale and almost as many at the top. Quite a few two-year-olds on their second birthday are producing only a handful of words (or at least their parents say they are) and others are producing nearly all of the 680 listed on the form (as well as others, in all likelihood). One way to describe these data is to consider the relationship of the variance to the central tendency. The “coefficient of variation” (CV) is a common measure used for this purpose: \\[CV = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\mu}\\] This statistic allows standardized comparison of variability across measurements with different scales, an important concern when we want to compare forms with very different numbers of vocabulary items. For example, for two-year-olds, the mean productive vocabulary is 319 words, and the standard deviation is 175, words, leading to a CV of 0.55. But, as seen in Figure @ref(fig:v_histogram), the distribution of productive vocabulary scores is far from normal; this trend is even more apparent at the younger and older ages. Thus, a non-parametric approach is more appropriate. Accordingly, we compute the MADM statistic, the non-parametric equivalent of the CV. In MADM, the mean \\(\\mu\\) is replaced by the median (\\(m(x)\\), and the standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) is replaced by the mean absolute deviation (which captures how far away values are from the median): \\[MADM(x) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i = 1..n}{|x_i - m(x)|}}{m(x)}\\] In American English production, this ratio is actually close to 1 from age one until almost age two, suggesting that the standard difference from the median is actually as big as the median itself! The decline begins before variability is substantially truncated by the ceiling of the form, suggesting that variability between kids is really highest before the second birthday. Imagine groups of three children. A group where one produced 30 words, one produced 100, and another produced 170 would have a MADM of 0.99. In contrast, one where they were more closely grouped – say 70, 100, 130 – would have a MADM of 0.44. The next figure shows MADM across languages and instruments. This similarity in variability structure is quite striking, such that between the first and second birthdays, language is remarkably variable. Yet this variability is quite consistent! We summarize the MADM in the second year of life by taking its mean. This mean is close to 1 for almost every language and form for which we have data. One question that could be raised regarding the analysis above is the extent to which variability is caused by variability across children vs. variability in reporting. The extreme values seen in the English data, for example, could easily be the result of a mixture of lazy parents who stopped answering the form with overly diligent parents who misunderstood and checked every box for a word they thought the child had been exposed to. Several arguments speak against this account, however. First, to the extent these biases are the source of variability, they are extremely consistent across languages – which, recall, is the exact opposite argument from the one we considered above (where parent diligence was supposed to be variable enough across samples to lead to differences between languages). In addition, note that the In sum, although there are certainly some reporting biases represented in the data, these results do not appear likely to be an artifact of reporting bias. We can complete the same analysis using comprehension data. Here we see a gradual decrease in variability throughout development. The intercept for the 12-18 month period appears to be lower than that observed in production, despite (or because of?) the higher scores. This observation matches one made by (???), namely that production vocabulary appears more idiosyncratic in distribution of words than comprehension vocabulary.One speculative explanation for this difference would be the tremendous differences in speech-motor development (as well as general differences in loquacity) between toddlers. This variability would then carry over into production. Another possibility, however, is that true variability is masked by the overall lower reliability of comprehension items (see Appendix C). Our data do not allow us to distinguish between these two explanations. In sum, we observed a striking consistency in the individual variability of children’s vocabulary during their second year. Across languages and forms, it appears to be the norm that toddlers vary. As Eriksson et al. (2012) write, “Using raw data assumes that each form is exhaustive, while using percentages assumes that each form is equally exhaustive. Neither is correct and the truth lies somewhere in between.”↩ An alternative possibility is that both accounts are true, but unconnected: 8-month-olds could in fact know some common words, but parents could be overestimating their vocabulary based on observed behaviors – in essence, parents could be right, but for the wrong reasons.↩ Feldman et al. (2000) discusses the possibility that some portion of the observed variability in her data as well as the CDI norming data (L. Fenson et al. 1994) is due to reporting issues. In their response, L. Fenson et al. (2000) cite an unpublished dataset comparing lab-based elicited production and parent report for 36 object names and show that the standard deviation is greater than the mean on both measures, suggesting that the variability found in CDI scores is not artifactual.↩ "],
["demographics.html", "5 Demographic Variables 5.1 Sex 5.2 Birth order 5.3 Maternal education", " 5 Demographic Variables Chapter 4 examined cross-linguistic consistency and variability in children’s reported vocabulary. In this chapter, we follow up these analyses by beginning the process – which will span throughout the book – of attempting to understand the nature and sources of these differences. In particular, we take advantage of the sample diversity described in Chapter 3 to explore differences in the median trajectory of vocabulary growth within demographic groups, focusing on three variables that are relatively available in our data: sex, maternal education, and birth order. Our goal is to develop a framework for comparing the magnitude of these effects. One important tension in this chapter reflects many earlier discussions of variability in CDI scores (from L. Fenson et al. 1994, Feldman et al. (2000), and Eriksson et al. (2012), among others). While some demographic differences in vocabulary are quite consistent – substantially so, as it turns out – the overall proportion of variance in vocabulary that they capture is still relatively limited. We will examine a number of different perspectives on how to quantify this relationship, moving back and forth between emphasizizing consistency in differences in the central tendency and emphasizing the limited size of these effects relative to the variability documented in Chapter 4. Our analyses in this chapter are unfortunately limited to a subset of languages, as demographic data for many contributed datasets were not available. We begin with sex, the variable for which the most analysis has already been done and for which we have the most data, then move on to birth order and finally maternal education. 5.1 Sex Our first analysis examines how vocabulary development differs by children’s sex.10 The literature on cognitive differences due to sex is vast, controversial in many places, and difficult to summarize (see D. I. Miller and Halpern 2014 for a useful recent review). Focusing on development, Maccoby and Jacklin (1974) began the enterprise of systematizing and summarizing gender differences. Their conclusions were largely deflationary but did suggest some differences in aggression and verbal ability (which were suggested to emerge in the period of early adolescence). This latter claim is most relevant for our analysis, but has been subject to controversy as well. Using meta-analytic tools, Hyde and Linn (1988) found that differences in verbal ability were minimal, but more recent studies have suggested consistent verbal ability differences. For example, Stoet and Geary (2013) found differences in reading ability across nations in a massive elementary education dataset (the PISA assessment), with variance in the magnitude of difference but girls very consistently showing an advantage. Similarly, Robinson and Lubienski (2011) reported consistent differences in reading ability (favoring girls) at the onset of kindergarten in a nationally-representative US sample. It almost goes without saying that these findings are subject to the full range of possible explanations articulated in the literature. These range from caregiver and academic socialization (e.g., self-fulfilling expectations that girls are more verbal) to “self socialization” in which affiliative differences produce differences in behavior, all the way to biological explanations.11 While descriptive data of the type cited above (and reported in our analyses below) can be more or less consistent with some of these theories, conclusive evidence will not be forthcoming. Our analyses below replicate and extend the results of Eriksson et al. (2012), who used an overlapping sample of CDI data from 12 languages to explore sex effects on vocabulary size.12 5.1.1 Comprehension We begin by examining Words and Gestures data on comprehension. Our first plot shows comprehension on Words and Gestures. Visual inspection of the data suggest limited differences, but a female advantage in some languages (most pronounced in Korean, Latvian, and Hebrew). Note that many authors do not find gender differences in early comprehension (e.g., Eriksson et al. 2012). Feldman et al. (2000) also did not using a large, relatively representative American dataset, though they had data only from younger children (10-13 months). We can examine the statistical models to get a clearer picture. For each language, we fit a robust generalized linear model predicting vocabulary size (number of words understood out of the total) predicted by age, and the interaction of age and gender. We specified this simple model so that the coefficient estimate on the age by gender interaction provides a convenient summary of the difference in vocabulary growth across groups. Despite the small magnitudes of the coefficients, 0 of 21 languages had a female advantage. In contrast, 0 showed a male advantage and the remainder did not show a significant gender by age interaction. Moving away from the model-based method above, we can look for a measure of effect size (similar to that used in the previous chapter). Effect size quantifies the size of the difference between groups in terms of the variability, producing a scale-free measure of difference that is appropriate for comparison across languages. Normally we’d use a measure like Cohen’s \\(d\\) here, where \\[d = \\frac{\\mu_2 - \\mu_1}{SD_{pooled}}\\] But as in the previous chapter, we have the problem of non-normal distributions. To circumvent this issue, we use a non-parametric measure derived from the same components: the difference between medians, divided by the MAD. (We call this the MMAD). Applying this measure to the data on comprehension, we see a quite small average female advantage that appears relatively constant across age. For those languages with dense enough data, we can take a weighted average of this pattern across ages, which reveals substantial variability. The overall median for these 15 languages is quite small as well, 0.1. In summary, there is some evidence for a modest female advantage in comprehension. 5.1.2 Production (Words and Gestures) We next turn to production data. As in many of our subsequent analyses, data on production from Words and Gestures forms tend to be at floor, so they are of limited utility and the faiulure to find differences may reflect floor effects rather than any true differences. Visual inspection confirms differences at the edge of the age range covered by Words and Gestures forms, however, so for completeness we give the comparable statistical analyses as above. Here 0 of 21 languages show a statistically significant female advantage. Examining the MMAD effect size measures, it is clear that there is limited signal in early production but the overall trend appears to be for a slight developmental increase from around 12 - 20 months. In addition, overall effect sizes are larger than in comprehension, with a median effect of 0.27, though in this analysis, averaging across age may be less warranted. 5.1.3 Production (Words and Sentences) We next turn to production data on the Words and Sentences instrument, which we expect to be much more informative regarding production. Visual inspection confirms differences in almost every case, and an analysis of the fitted models shows that 0 of 24 languages show a statistically significant female advantage! We next turn to the MMAD effect size measure. Here we see a relatively consistent difference across ages with perhaps a slight downward trend in effect size. This downward trend might be a function of ceiling effects on the form, however, as seen in the model-fit curves above for, e.g., Danish. When variability is limited by the form ceiling, effect size estimates will necessarily be depressed. The median female advantage is 0.4, substantially larger than that seen in early comprehension and somewhat larger than that seen in early production (perhaps due to floor effects early on). 5.1.4 Reporting Bias? Do these differences reflect differences in measurement that are unique to the CDI? One way of addressing this question is to examine other studies of ex that have been found in other studies. Unfortunately, many of the studies reporting differences themselves rely on the CDI, likely for the reasons reviewed in Chapter 1, e.g. (Bauer, Goldfield, and Reznick 2002,L. Fenson et al. (1994),Feldman et al. (2000)). For exmaple, Feldman et al. (2000) collects CDIs with a large dataset of low-income American English speakers around 12 and 24 months. In those data, early comprehension showed no significant difference but production at 24 months showed a difference comparable to what we observed (\\(N = 2156\\), \\(d = .35\\), recomputed from provided summary statistics). These data, while providing replication in an independent dataset, do not speak to whether reporting biases contributed to or created the observed sex effects. For external validation, we turn to two other studies that provide more objective (non parent-report) measurements of early language. First, a seminal study by Huttenlocher et al. (1991) measured gender effects in vocabulary size as estimated from a naturalistic sample of production and found substantial differences in vocabulary growth favoring girls. Although the measurements from this study are not comparable, the effects are quite large (and are relatively unaffected by controlling for maternal language exposure). #&gt; [1] 193 Second, Bornstein and Putnick (2012) use a particularly powerful study design to examine stability in early language estimates across different measures. They gathererd longitudinal data at 20 and 48 months using a wide range of standardized and parent-report measures, and then use structural equation modeling to model shared variance due to parent report as well as standardized latent language ability at each age. We digitized data from their Figure 2 to examine the size of the gender differences in the latent vocabulary construct that they recovered.13 As these scores are standardized, we can examine the difference in means and recover the standardized effect size for gender in the data, which is 0.62 standard deviations. Since this measurement is greater than that found in the CDI measurements for our study (the comparable American English measurement was 0.35), we doubt that our observed effect is due solely to reporting bias. 5.1.5 Discussion In summary, we found a considerable and strikingly consistent cross-linguistic female advantage in early language production (replicating and extennding Eriksson et al. 2012). A much smaller but still relatively consistent female advantage was reported in comprehension. We suspect that neither of these effects are due to parental reporting bias. First, our review of the literature suggests that more objective measures yield similar effects to the extent that we were able to compare. Second, comprehension is very likely to be the measure more affected by reporting biases as it is likely to be more subjective (Feldman et al. 2000; L. Fenson et al. 2000). In contrast, we find a much smaller effect in comprehension. As noted above, we remain agnostic about the causes of these differences, but in Chapter ?? we discuss inferences from consistency across languages in much more detail. 5.2 Birth order The Only 8 languages have birth order data. Only 7 languages have it for WS, and only 5 languages for WG. 5.2.1 Comprehension 5.2.2 Production (WG) 5.2.3 Production (WS) 5.3 Maternal education From health to education, children from lower socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds tend to be at higher risk for a variety of negative developmental outcomes, compared to their higher-SES peers (Bradley &amp; Corwin, 2002). A large literature documents specific relations between SES and children’s early language abilities, especially oral vocabulary, which is in turn related to outcomes when children begin formal education (e.g., Durham et al., 2007; Hart &amp; Risley, 2006; Hoff, 2002; Marchman &amp; Fernald, 2008). Environmental explanations of these SES effects are often given in terms of indirect factors that affect life opportunities or experiences, such as nutrition and access to health care, as well as more direct factors that impact daily life, such as smoking during pregnancy, access to quality child care, or amount of time caregivers spend in interactions with their young children. Alternatively, even early language shows a significant genetic component, raising the possibility that SES-vocabulary links may instead be genetically mediated (Hayiou-Thomas et al., 2012). Cross-national comparisons may shed light on the factors that lead to relations between SES and children’s vocabulary outcomes. On the one hand, relatively constant relations across language communities that vary widely in indirect and direct factors that shape learning would provide prima facie support for genetic explanations. In contrast, a greater degree of cross-national variability would point to the origins of SES effects in aspects of children’s early environments that vary with SES to differing degrees across countries (e.g., Siddiqi et al., 2007; L. C. H. Fernald et al., 2012). Our current study addresses this issue in very young children using data from the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (MB-CDI), a family of reliable and valid parent-report instruments for measuring early vocabulary development in children under 3 years (Fenson et al., 2007). We take advantage of Wordbank, a new database of more than 10,000 MB-CDI instruments from six countries (Frank et al., 2016). We use maternal education as a proxy for SES, following previous work suggesting that maternal education is strongly related to SES variation (Bornstein et al., 2003; Hoff, 2002). 5.3.1 Production (WG) 5.3.2 Production (WS) 5.3.3 Explanations Our findings show that the relations between maternal education and children’s vocabulary outcomes is highly variable across countries. The observational nature of our data precludes strong inferences about the precise factors that lead to these differences, though speculation is certainly possible. The large magnitude of the differences across countries suggests a powerful role for environmental factors in shaping variation in child outcomes even before the age of 3 years. Findings from the present study support the proposal that inequalities in factors that are linked to child well being should be addressed early in life. Since features of the quantity and quality of caregiver linguistic input has been strongly implicated in early language development, future research should focus on policy interventions that facilitate children’s access to high quality talk by caregivers, including care availability and parental leave. 5.3.4 Reporting biases The data suggest that different scales of the CDI may be susceptible to differential reporting biases in different subgroups of the population. On CDI sec- tions that require considerable subjective interpreta- tion of observations, parents with low educational and income levels, who were underrepresented in the CDI norming sample, seem to overestimate their child’s abilities in comparison with parents with more education and income. For example, the Phrase and Vocabulary Comprehension sections of the CDI-WG require parents to make potentially difficult judg- ments about their children’s levels of understanding. Negative correlations were found between scores on both of these sections and maternal education and health insurance status. Parents in general may have difficulty in distinguishing between comprehension that is based solely on verbal input and comprehen- sion that is based on a variety of nonlinguistic cues and contextual supports to meaning (Chapman, 1978). Some parents may recall times when the words were used in the child’s presence and may confuse ex- posure with understanding. Some may credit the child with comprehension if the child seems to under- stand the word in a highly constrained situation. These difficulties may explain why parental reports of verbal comprehension in this age range are higher than results of direct testing (Tomasello &amp; Mervis 1994). They also may explain why correlations be- tween parental reports and comprehension scores from other methods are extremely low (Reznick, 1990). One discussion in Feldman et al. (2000) and (???) is that there may be reporting biases, particularly in comprehension, for children in the youngest age groups. (???) also found a negative correlation between SES and vocabulary in a subgroup analysis. We examine reported comprehension vocabulary % --> % --> % --> Throughout, we will assume that parents report on children’s biological sex, rather than their gender identity.↩ As an illustrative example, some literature has implicated fetal testosterone, though by a Lutchmaya, Baron-Cohen, and Raggatt (2001) used CDI meausures and recovered an effect somewhat similar to ours with a small sample (\\(d = .64\\) at 18 months with \\(N=87\\)), and \\(d = .60\\) at 24 months for a subsample). They found some relationship with fetal testosterone across sexes, but it did not hold up within sex (perhaps due to small samples). The mechanism by which testosterone translates into vocabulary growth is unclear however.↩ An earlier version of this analysis was reported in M. C. Frank et al. (2016).↩ These data are not perfect, I have double-digitized one point.↩ "],
["categories.html", "6 Categorical Composition: Syntax14 6.1 Introduction 6.2 Methods and Data 6.3 Results", " 6 Categorical Composition: Syntax14 This chapter focuses on splitting vocabulary data into syntactic categories and analyzing consistency and variability across languages in the acquisition of these. We quantify the “noun bias” across languages. In addition, we report the degree of bias for or against verbs and closed-class words. In Chapter 15, we consider variation of this sort within individuals. 6.1 Introduction Over the first few years, young children are exposed to a “sea of words” across many different contexts and from many different people (p. 516, J. Goodman, Dale, and Li 2008). And despite the fact that children vary tremendously in the rate at which they learn, the first words that children utter are strikingly consistent (Tardif et al. 2008,Schneider, Yurovsky, and Frank (2015)): They tend to talk about important people in their life (mom, dad), social routines (hi, uh oh), animals (dog, duck), and foods (milk, banana) (J. Goodman, Dale, and Li 2008, Bates et al. (1995); Nelson 1973; E. V. Clark 1979). Soon thereafter, they begin to add verbs (go) and adjectives (pretty) in greater proportions than earlier in development and may even begin to use closed-class forms, such as determiners (the). These patterns seem to suggest a developmental course that follows distinct “waves” of learning for words from different classes. That is, along with early social routines, nouns tend to predominate early vocabularies, while other types of words, such as predicates and closed class forms, are learned later. The composition of early vocabulary is complicated by the fact that we categorize words by their adult syntactic category. We do so in the discussion below without presupposing that children themselves do this categorization, however (Tomasello 2000). Children may be sensitive to these categories very early in development (Valian 1986,Yang (2013)) or they may discover them either gradually (Pine and Lieven 1997) or more quickly (Meylan et al. 2017). Importantly, though, we treat adult syntactic categories as an analytic convenience that describes certain regularities in how groups of words are distributed in language samples and how they function in different contexts, rather than as an ontological fact about children’s knowledge. Chapter 11 breaks down these categories further, asking what sorts of information predicts the order of acquisition for individual words, both within and across categories. Figure 6.1: Figure from Bates et al. (1994), showing developmental trends in the categorical composition of early vocabulary Bates et al. (1994) characterized these patterns of vocabulary composition in the following way. The figure above (reprinted from that paper) shows average vocabulary composition of nominals, predicates and closed class forms as a function of children’s vocabulary size for English-speaking children from the original norming study of CDI: Words &amp; Sentences form (L. Fenson et al. 1994). Note that when children only know a few words (e.g., fewer than 50 words), the nominals comprise the greatest proportion of the words that children are reported to produce, with very few predicates or closed class forms (&lt; 10%). As the children learn the next hundred words or so, the proportion of nominals increases even more dramatically with a gradual increase in the proportion of children’s vocabularies that are predicates. Closed class forms remain a much smaller proportion over the period. Yet after about 300 words or so, children tend not add nouns to their vocabularies at the same pace that they did earlier in development, reflected in the proportion of nominals tending to decrease.15 It is during this developmental period that proportion of predicates tend to increase, followed by a growing proportion of closed class forms. Why do children learn nouns before verbs and other types of words? This question has received a great deal of attention in the literature, and we can briefly summarize some of the major issues here. One reason for this “noun bias” could be that nouns are simply more frequent in the talk to young children. It is well-established that children learn the words that they hear more often (e.g., Hart and Risley 1995). Many observational studies of English-speaking caregivers have demonstrated that caregivers use more nouns than verbs (types or tokens) with their children (e.g., A. Fernald and Morikawa 1993; Goldfield 1993; Gopnik, Choi, and Baumberger 1996; Kim, McGregor, and Thompson 2000; Poulin-Dubois, Graham, and Sippola 1995; Tardif, Shatz, and Naigles 1997). Other researchers have framed the “noun bias” in terms of universals about what and how different words “partition” things in the world.For example, Gentner (1978) has argued that children learn nouns before verbs because the meanings of nouns are easier to encode since they identify things that can be differentiated in the world (e.g., common everyday objects). Verbs and other predicates, in contrast, express relations among things in the world. Hence, the meanings of verbs are less accessible to children through common, everyday experiences and hence, are more difficult to map onto word forms without additional linguistic or social support. Other reasons that nouns might be easier than verbs for young children is that nouns tend to be less morphologically complex than verbs (e.g., Tardif, Shatz, and Naigles 1997). For example, in many languages, nouns are typically marked only for number, whereas, verbs carry both person and tense information. In English, at least, verbs might also be harder to learn because they tend to occur in sentence-medial position (rather than sentence final), which make verbs less salient in the input that children hear (Slobin and others 1985; M. Caselli et al. 1995). Finally, differences in children’s preferences for nouns vs. verbs might result from differences in what contexts children hear nouns vs. verbs in the speech from caregivers (e.g., Choi and Gopnik 1995; Tardif, Gelman, and Xu 1999). Several researchers have examined what caregivers talk about using naturalistic data of caregiver-child interactions. For example, caregivers in some cultures tend to emphasize the names for objects, spending a great deal of time labeling objects for their children. In other cultures, caregivers do so much less frequently, instead focusing on the actions in which those objects engage (e.g., A. Fernald and Morikawa 1993; Gopnik, Choi, and Baumberger 1996). These differences in input to children can influence the words that are salient for children, and hence, the words that they are most likely to learn. What is the evidence that a noun bias is a universal feature of children’s vocabularies? Documenting the extent to which the noun bias is universal is relevant to understanding mechanisms of language learning, in particular, the presence of conceptual biases in early acquisition and the role of cross-cultural variability in the input that children receive from caregivers. The evidence varies across languages, as well as across methodologies (for example, naturalistic observation vs. parent report). Some studies find consistent evidence for a noun bias in English, as well as in Korean and Italian (Bates et al. 1994; Au, Dapretto, and Song 1994; M. Caselli et al. 1995; Kim, McGregor, and Thompson 2000). Other studies do not find evidence of a noun bias in languages as varied as French, German, Chinese, Estonian, and Korean (Bassano 2000; Lois Bloom, Tinker, and Margulis 1993; Choi and Gopnik 1995; Kauschke and Hofmeister 2002; Tardif 1996; Tardif, Gelman, and Xu 1999; Schults and Tulviste 2016). In sum, identifying the extent of cross-linguistic variation vs. universals has been difficult since variation across studies may be due to the different methodologies that are used. For example, even within a single language, for example, Korean, parent reports of children’s first words find a noun bias (e.g., Au, Dapretto, and Song 1994), whereas, studies using direct observational methods find less evidence for this pattern (e.g., Gopnik, Choi, and Baumberger 1996). Further, few studies have had the scope to directly compare the extent of the noun bias across multiple languages using a common methodology. One notable exception in a literature where samples have been small – in terms of both languages and children – is Bornstein et al. (2004), in which the researchers compared vocabulary composition in seven different languages. In this chapter, we follow this comparative approach (see also Tardif et al. 2008). Since we have access to many more observations, our approach offers a more comprehensive approach than these earlier studies. Moreover, we attempt to quantify the estimates of the extent to which languages show a noun bias: we develop a statistical method for quantifying the extent of the noun bias across the entire developmental range in which a particular form is used. 6.2 Methods and Data Each CDI form contains a mixture of words in different classes. We adopt the categorization of Bates et al. (1994), categorizing words into nouns, predicates (both verbs and adjectives), function words (also referred to as “closed class” words), and other words. For each child’s vocabulary, we compute the proportion of the total words in each of these categories that they are reported to produce. Following the approach developed by Bates et al. (1994), for each of the languages in our sample, we plot these proportions against total vocabulary. Each dot represents a child’s knowledge of a particular class, while curves show the relationship between a class and the whole vocabulary. If categories grow independently of one another, these curves should approximate the diagonal. We limit our analysis to traditional WS and WG forms (along with variants in these classes) because short forms like the British English TEDS don’t typically include category information. The sample sizes included in this analysis are given above. Figure 6.2: Schematic of our vocabulary composition analysis. Building on the method of Bates et al. (1994), our analyses relies on plotting the proportion of words known in a particular category (e.g., nouns) in a child’s vocabulary by the proportion of all words in the child’s vocabulary. This approach is shown schematically above. If every time a child learns a word, that word is sampled randomly from the different words available on the form, then the proportion of nouns in vocabulary should track perfectly with the proportion of total vocabulary (the diagonal). In contrast, if nouns are over-represented, the child will be represented by a point above the diagonal; if nouns are under-represented, they will be under the diagonal. The figure above shows this analysis, carried out with English (American) WS data. Each point shows an individual child’s vocabulary, and each panel shows a different lexical class (thus each child is represented once in each panel). We capture the overall trend in this plot by estimating a linear model over the data, predicting category proportion as a function of total production. This model is fit with third-order polynomials (so as to allow both concave/convex functions and also changes in convexity). We fit these models with the constraint that they must predict the point [1,1] so that they are guaranteed to arrive at the diagonal point in the special case that all words on a form are checked. These model fits are shown by the lines. The final step in our method is to capture the overall bias in a particular sample by estimating the difference in area between the curve and the diagonal. If the curve is substantially above the diagonal, this difference will be positive (indicating e.g., a positive noun bias). In contrast, if the curve is below the diagonal, the difference will be negative. To capture uncertainty in this area estimate, we conduct a resampling analysis where we randomly resample the population 1000 times with replacement, then recompute the area measurement. Confidence intervals below are based on this resampling procedure. Critically, this analysis controls for a number of confounds in previous analyses. First, because our interest is in the shape of the overall curve, under-representation of children in some age-band should add uncertainty but not bias. Of course, if data are too sparse, estimates will be unconstrained, but particulars of age sampling should not bias our estimates. Second, in principle, the analysis should not be biased by the number of items in a particular category, as the analysis is relative to the numerical representation of a particular class on the form. Thus, in principle we should be able to compare across forms with larger or smaller numbers of items in particular sections. 6.3 Results We present results of this analysis across languages, beginning with comprehension on WG-type forms and moving to production in WS-type forms. We do not analyze WG production data here. For the most part, production estimates on WG forms are quite low, and hence curves are relatively unconstrained (or determined by a small number of children who are reported to have very large early vocabulary). 6.3.1 Comprehension: Words and Gestures Comprehension results are shown above. Overall, the largest trend that is visible in these plots is the under-representation of function words, with nouns and predicates appearing quite close to one another. For further comparison, we show summaries of curve areas for each language below. Nouns are over-represented in many – but not all – languages. Portuguese, Turkish, Korean, and Slovak, a set of typologically- and culturally-distinct languages, show slight under representation, with BSL and British English showing the largest over-representation of nouns. Predicates are under-represented in some languages and over-represented in others. As seen above, there is a strong anti-correlation between noun and predicate bias measures (\\(r\\)(20) = -0.78). (This correlation should be interpreted with caution as nouns + predicates + function words are constrained to sum to 1, so some degree of correlation is built into the measure). Function words are substantially under-represented across nearly every language in our sample (except Slovak). Note the scale difference – the function-word values are far more extreme than the noun and predicate values. These results likely reflect some combination of true under-representation of function-words as well as the difficulty of reporting on function-word comprehension in very early language (see Appendix C for more details on this issue). Such issues may also vary across cultures, languages, and administration methods. Function-word representation might plausibility differ due to linguistic factors such as morphological complexity, pronoun dropping, agreement, etc. However, it is also notable that the two lowest function-word scores come from Kiswahili and Kigiriama (Alcock et al. 2015), a study in which the parents may have had substantially less meta-linguistic awareness as a result of many being illiterate. 6.3.2 Production: Words and Sentences We next turn to production data from WS-type forms. We can immediately see the same function-word trend as was visible in comprehension. In addition, in many but not all languages, a noun bias is evident. Turning to the language summaries, we see a larger pattern of variation in nouns and predicate representation. Every language has a relative over-representation of nouns, though the degree of this over-representation varies, with German and Korean especially high, and Mandarin and Cantonese especially low (we return to this trend below). Overall this trend is more extreme and more consistent in production data than comprehension. Predicate representation is both more variable and more negative than we observed for comprehension. Here we see Mandarin and Cantonese as the only two languages with substantial over-representation for predicates. Noun and predicate representation is again anti-correlated, at \\(r\\)(24) = -0.64, though this correlation is somewhat weaker than for comprehension. The negative representation of function words is relatively consistent in overall magnitude with that seen in comprehension. Across all languages, children are reported to produce fewer function words than would be expected by chance sampling. 6.3.3 Reliability of bias estimates One natural question is how consistent estimates of bias are across comprehension and production. The plot above shows – for the sample of languages in which we have data from matched WG- and WS-type instruments – the relative bias we recovered in the analysis above. Somewhat surprisingly, correlations between these different instruments are quite low. Function word bias is negatively correlated between production and comprehension (\\(r\\)(18) = -0.4, \\(p\\) = 0.085). This result is likely due to Kiswahili and Kigiriama, discussed above, the lowest points for function word comprehension. But predicate bias estimates are close to uncorrelated with one another (\\(r\\)(18) = -0.11, \\(p\\) = 0.65), and the correlation between noun bias estimates is modest though positive (\\(r\\)(18) = 0.39, \\(p\\) = 0.09). This analysis is relatively low power; it only conducted with 18 languages and hence is relatively low power (despite the many thousands of children necessary to carry it out). Despite this, it casts some doubt on the reliability of individual bias estimates. An earlier version of this work was reported to the Boston University Conference on Language Development in 2015 by Braginsky, Marchman, Yurovsky, &amp; Frank.↩ This effect may also reflect aspects of CDI form design, e.g. “running out of nouns” to learn: children may increasingly learning nouns that are not on the forms.↩ "],
["categories-semantic.html", "7 Categorical Composition: Semantics", " 7 Categorical Composition: Semantics Following the approach in the previous chapter, we investigate the consistency of semantic content categories across languages. By analogy with the “noun bias,” are some languages “vehicle-focused”?

["introduction-methods-and-an-example.html", "8 Introduction, Methods, and an Example 8.1 Results 8.2 Dimensionality Reduction Approach 8.3 Specific semantic categories", " 8 Introduction, Methods, and an Example In contrast to the “noun bias” literature, where a wide variety of hypotheses have been articulated over the preceeding decades, differences in content have been less explored and so these analyses are far more exploratory. To limit the scope of this exploration, we focus on WS-type forms and production measures, which we have reason to believe will be most reliable. In these analyses, we take advantage of the fact that CDI forms are typically structured into semantic categories (e.g., “animals” or “body parts”). As the figure above shows, while some semantic categories are shared across many instruments, thers are others that are quite rare (many corresponding to specific syntactic categories that are of interest in particular languages). We focus on those semantic categories with greater representation in the data. Further, to avoid duplicating our analysis in Chapter 6, we focus on those semantic categories that fall into “nouns” and “other” lexical classes. (In general, “action words” and “descriptive words” tend to be broad predicate classes without as much clear semantic differentiation). This filtering step leaves 14 categories: animals, body_parts, clothing, food_drink, furniture_rooms, games_routines, household, outside, people, places, sounds, time_words, toys, and vehicles. Samples included in this analysis are shown below We first illustrate this approach using data from the English WS form alone. Analogous to the plots in 6, the plot above shows areas where the data deviate from the pattern of category acquisition predicted by random item sampling. The size of the shaded region above vs. below the diagonal gives evidence of over- vs. under-sampling for a particular semantic category. Many of the results of this analysis for English are expected. Sounds items are heavily over-represented, as are Body Parts, Games and Routines, and to a slightly lesser extent, Toys, Animals, and Vehicles. These particular biases are likely related particular parenting practices, cultural emphases (for example, on animal names), and young childrens’ idiosyncratic interests. For a more in-depth examination of the consistencies in very early vocabulary, see Chapter 9; for more detail on what makes particular words easier or harder to learn, see Chapter 11. The largest under-representation across categories is Time Words. This pattern is consistent with a body of work on children’s acquisition of the semantics of time words that suggests that children struggle with understanding these complex terms through age five (Tillman and Barner 2015,Tillman et al. (2017)). We next turn to how this pattern varies across languages. 8.1 Results Because there are so many different languages represented in this analysis, the simplest analysis examines the spread of languages across categories. Somewhat surprisingly, the ordering of categories looks quite similar to what was observed in English. Sounds, Games and Routines, and Body parts are all over-represented. Vehicles, Food and Drink, Animals, and Clothing all are variable across cultures, as is People. Houshold, Outside, and Furniture and Rooms show variability but overall less bias. Fianlly, Places and Time Word are both under-represented systematically across all languages. We can zoom in on the most highly over-represeented categories. The highest mean comes from body parts, which are over-represented in just about every language. Interestingly, the three datasets with the lowest proportion of body parts are the two Mandarin datasets (WS and TC) and the Cantonese WS data. Games and routines are generally over-represented but somewhat more variable, with Kiswahili, Kigiriama, and Mandarin TC data lowest 8.2 Dimensionality Reduction Approach 8.2.1 WS Production Nouns Scree plot, indicating that PC1 dominates (for nouns, at least).

["items.html", "9 Individual Words: Consistencies", " 9 Individual Words: Consistencies Which words do children learn first? In spite of tremendous individual variation in rate of development (1), the first words that children utter are strikingly consistent (Tardif et al. 2008): they tend to talk about important people in their life (“mom”, “dad”), social routines (“hi”, “uh oh”), animals (“dog”, “duck”), and foods (“milk”, “banana”). As children learn from their experiences and according to their own interests (Mayor and Plunkett 2014) their vocabulary grows rapidly, typically adding more nouns, but also verbs (“go”) and other predicates (“hot”) to their production repertoires. In the latter part of this chapter, we ask why some words are learned before others. But first, we ask the prior question: How similar are the acquisition trajectories of children learning different languages? Similar trajectories–no matter their proximal causes–suggest that these causes are consistent across languages. Because the CDIs are adaptations and not translations, the individual item inventories vary significantly across languages. Nonetheless, when translation equivalents exist on multiple forms we can look at the variability in how quickly they are acquired across languages. Some words about AOA estimation–OR MAYBE NOT?

Analyses will focus on the cross-linguistic consistency and variability of reporting milestones like first pointing, as well as social routines like waving hi and playing peekaboo. Let’s try out some basic descriptives. What do these things look like? Let’s arrange them in order of difficulty(on the bases of highest proportion of non-producers). I can’t tell if sometimes/often really carries very much signal. It looks like it’s all over the place for the earliest gestures and almost overlapping for the latest ones. Let’s try compressing to a binary These look pretty reasonable to me, and a lot more stable. Also smacklip doesn’t seem to have much of any kind of trajectory, which makes me think that parents don’t know what do with it. For comparison, let’s try the other gesture categories. Interesting, ok most of these look like they have some signal (with the exception maybe of sobig). Also some of them don’t look terribly different from the First Gestures. Let’s try looking at correlations with vocabulary size Wow, age is really predictive of gesture, even more so than comprehension/production.

It also looks like there is some non-linearity in the correlation, because the age * comprehension/production correlations are negative. Presumably this is some kind of ceiling effect where the gestures in general are producted before the words? Let’s check that next. "],

On some accounts, children’s early syntax emerges from direct generalizations from particular lexical items, while on others, syntactic structure is acquired independently and follows its own timetable. CDI data can help us decide between these two views. In this chapter, we summarize the state of grammatical development across languages, (noting the challenges posed by radically different representations of grammar across CDI forms). We also replicate and generalize analyses linking grammatical generalization to children’s vocabulary size. We end by investigating the idea that that age modulates the relationship between grammar and the lexicon. 14.1 Introduction For many children, their first words are spoken in isolation. While these single word utterances sometimes seem to be picking out objects in the world (e.g., ball!), others seem to convey more complex ideas or desires (e.g., up! for Mommy, pick me up!). But by two years of age, many children have acquired a large repertoire of words, and are beginning to use them in two- or three-word combinations (e.g., Mommy up! or kitty sleep here). These utterances will gradually increase in length and complexity in various ways, forming sentences that increasingly reflect the grammatical structure of their native language (e.g., Mommy, the kitty is sleeping here). Children also begin to add more verbs, adjectives and other predicates to their working vocabularies (see Chapter 6, and substantively increase their use of prepositions, articles and other closed class forms that do grammatical work, including the productive use of inflectional morphemes (e.g., English past tense ed or ing). Understanding the origins of grammar is critical because children’s ability to use morphosyntactically-rich language is thought to reflect the uniquely-human mental machinary that enables speakers to produce novel utterances that have never been heard in the input (Berko (1958), (???)). The questions surrounding the development of grammar are challenging. How do abstract morphosyntactic structures emerge during language learning? What mechanisms underlie the formation of generalizations that support such inferences and allow children to apply them during language production? Does an understanding of the abstract rule-structure of language emerge from the interactions of individual words, or is that structure independently acquired and represented separately? Broadly speaking, theoretical views on grammatical development generally take one of two forms. On nativist theories like principles and parameters (Chomsky 1981; M. C. Baker 2005), grammar emerges independently from lexical knowledge following its own, largely maturational, timetable. Moreover, grammatical regularities are mentally represented in a format that is distinct from that used by the lexical system. In contrast, according to lexicalist theories, mental representations of morphosyntactic structure generally emerge from graded generalizations on the basis of lexical items, and at least early in development, there may be little or no representation of morphosyntactic rules or regularities per se (Tomasello 2003, Elman et al. (1996)). Even when syntactic structures are eventually represented, these representations are directly related to more concrete lexical structures (Bannard, Lieven, and Tomasello 2009). Historically, the study of individual differences has been critial to this debate. While variation in word learning is generally uncontroversial, individual differences in grammatical development is less clearly aligned with a universalist, nativist perspective. In contrast, lexicalist theories predict that variation in grammatical development should be tightly yoked to variation in lexical development (Bates and Goodman 1999). Research has shown that, as with lexical development, there is sizeable variation in exactly when and how children move into using more grammatically complex utterances in their everyday speech. While some children use primarily multi-word phrases and many closed class forms by 24 months, other children are still primarily producing nouns in single word utterances at that same age (e.g., (???); Bates and Goodman (1999)). Moreover, there is also variation in the kinds of multi-word utterances that children produce. For example, some children build up sentences from individual words (e.g., want dat!), whereas, other children seem to produce utterances that reflect “unanalyzed” chunks of more complex speech (e.g., iwantdodat!). Critically, associations between individual differences in lexical and grammatical development have been robustly substantiated in the literature. Based on the original norming data from the English CDI: Words &amp; Sentences, children with more sophisticated grammatical productions were also those children with the largest vocabularies (Bates et al. (1994)). Using that same dataset, Marchman and Bates (1994) found that size of verb vocabulary was concurrently related to children’s overregularization of past tense inflections (e.g., daddy goed), productions that are viewed as a major milestone in the development of grammatical rule-based knowledge. MAY WANT TO TRIM DOWN THESE REFERENCES. STILL NEED TO PUT IN BIB. Links between lexical development and grammar have also been reported longitudinally ((???); Bates and Goodman (1997)), in late talkers (e.g., Paul, 1996, 1997; Rescorla &amp; Schwartz, 1993; Rescorla, Roberts &amp; Dahlsgaard, 1997, 2000; Thal &amp; Tobias, 1994; Thal &amp; Katich, 1996), early talkers (Thal, Bates, Zappia &amp; Oroz, 1996; Thal, Bates, Goodman, &amp; Jahn-Samilo, 1997), and children with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Williams syndrome (e.g., Singer-Harris, Bellugi, Bates, Jones, &amp; Rossen, 1997). Critically, similar relationships have also been demonstrated in many other languages, including Slovenian (Marjanovic-Umek, Fekonja-Peklaj, &amp; Podlesek, 2013), Hebrew (Maital, Dromi, Sagi, &amp; Bornstein, 2000), Icelandic (Thordardottir, Ellis Weismer, &amp; Evans, 2002), Italian (C. Caselli, Casadio, and Bates (1999); (???)), Bulgarian (Andonova, 2015), Finnish (e.g., (???)), Turkish (Turkay, 2013), Spanish (e.g., Mariscal &amp; Gallego, 2012; Thal, Jackson-Maldonado, and Acosta (2000)), and German (Szagun, Steinbrink, Franik, &amp; Stumper, 2006). Finally, strong heritability of the relation between lexical and grammatical level has been documented in behavioral genetic studies of monozygotic and dizygotic twins ((???)). In other words, even though genetic factors contribute relatively weakly to each aspect of language assessed individually, the genetic factors that influence lexical growth are the same as those that influence grammatical growth. COULD ADD BILINGUALS? While these studies substantiate that vocabulary and grammar development are strongly associated developmentally, the interpretation of these relations is still under debate. Some researchers have interpreted these links to suggest that domain-general learning mechanisms guide the child’s construction of a working linguistic system at many different levels, in this case, learning words and learning grammatical rules (e.g., Bresnan, Tomasello, Elman et al., 1996). As Bates and MacWhinney proposed many years ago, “the native speaker learns to map phrasal configurations onto propositions, using the same learning principles and representational mechanisms needed to map single words onto their meanings” ((???), p. 163). Other proposals suggest that the process of learning words involves learning both their lexical-semantic and their morphosyntactic properties (e.g., in what constructions they can legally appear and what inflectional morphemes are required). Other theories propose that grammatical knowledge is built up on a case-by-case basis. Early word combinations are often highly routinized and situation specific, suggesting that learning grammar, like word learning, is guided by learning mechanisms that are item specific and frequency dependent. It is only later that grammatical structures become encoded in terms of their abstract syntactic form (e.g. Akhtar, 1999; Lieven, Pine &amp; Baldwin, 1997; Tomasello, 2001). Finally, yet another accounts views the relation as reflecting mechanisms that operate in the opposite direction. Grammatical analysis is a driving force behind word learning, such that the process of analyzing sentences into their constituent grammatical parts facilitates the further acquisition of lexical-semantic knowledge (Anisfeld, Rosenberg, Hoberman &amp; Gasparini, 1998; Gleitman, 1990; (???)). 14.2 Goals of the current analyses In this chapter, we explore relations between estimates of children’s vocabulary size based on the vocabulary checklist and responses on other sections of the Words and Sentences instruments. Many versions of the instruments provide indices of grammar learning by asking about children’s use of inflected forms (e.g., walked), children’s use of overgeneralizations (e.g., goed), and the complexity of their word combinations (e.g., kitty sleeping / kitty is sleeping). While many studies have examined associations between lexical and grammatical development crosslinguistically, the scope and power of these early studies were limited, relying on relatively small norming samples (1000–2000 children) with few opportunities for direct comparisons of the nature or extent of these relations across multiple languages at the same time. The data available in Wordbank allows analyses of lexical-grammar relations with enhanced statistical power and broader cross-linguistic representation. In addition, we explore a hypothesis that was not explicitly tested in these earlier studies: that there remains age-related variance in grammatical development unexplained by vocabulary development. While the overall relationship between grammar and the lexicon provides support for lexicalist theories, the identification of age-related variance would suggest the presence of developmental processes that regulate grammar learning, above and beyond those captured by measures of vocabulary size. Such age-related processes could be either maturational or experiential, and either domain-general (like working memory) or language-specific (like grammatical competency). Importantly, since both nativist and constructivist theories could in principle predict age-linked variance in grammatical development, our goal is not to differentiate these theories, but instead to test this novel prediction and explore its implications for future work on understanding the processes of grammatical development. An additional contribution of work is that, due to the size of our dataset, we are able to make more fine-grained distinctions than the initial cut between grammar and the lexicon. In particular, we distinguish morphology from multi-word syntax, since morphological generalizations might be more specifically dependent on vocabulary size than those requiring more global, sentence-level syntactic regularities. 14.3 Methods In all 11 languages included in these analyses, the CDI forms contain both vocabulary checklists and other questions relevant to the child’s linguistic development. All of the data reported here come from the Words &amp; Sentences form, administered to children ages 16–32 months. Each of these instruments includes a Vocabulary section, which asks whether the child produces each of around 700 words from a variety of semantic and syntactic categories (e.g., foot, run, so); a Word Form section, which asks whether the child produces each of around 30 morphologically inflected forms of nouns and verbs (e.g., feet, ran); and a Complexity section, which asks whether the child’s speech is most similar to the syntactically simpler or more complex versions of around 40 sentences (e.g., two foot / two feet, there a kitty / there’s a kitty). Each language’s instrument is not just a translation of the English form, but rather was constructed and normed to reflect the lexicon and grammar of that language. To analyze lexical and grammatical development, we derive several measures. Each child’s Vocabulary Size is computed as the proportion of words on the corresponding CDI form that the child is reported to produce. Similarly, each child’s Word Form score is the proportion of word forms they are reported to produce, and their Complexity score the proportion of complexity items for which they are reported to use the more complex form. We compute all of these quantities as proportions to make the scales comparable across languages. 14.3.1 Items 14.4 Results 14.4.1 Combine 14.4.2 Grammar and lexicon relationship 14.4.3 Age effect 14.4.4 Individual items 14.5 Discussion The current study revisits classic findings but also explores novel questions regarding lexicon-grammar relations and vocabulary composition through Wordbank, a newly-developed web-based tool for cross-linguistic analyses of large CDI datasets. Our results provided general support for a lexicalist view, in that, in 11 languages, variance in vocabulary production strongly aligned with variance in grammar. However, we also estimated additional age-related contributions, specifically contrasting the links to morphological forms vs. syntactic constructions, and for different lexical categories. In general, we find that measures of grammar that are more closely aligned with syntax are modulated by age to a greater extent than those reflecting inflectional morphology. Our analyses suggest interesting new areas of research regarding possible mechanisms driving children’s early lexical development and how those mechanisms might support children’s transition from single words to more morphosyntactically complex utterances. One possibility is that these developments are dependent on maturational factors that operate on grammatical development in a domain-specific way, independent of lexical-semantic processes. Another possibility is that age-related effects represent more domain-general learning mechanisms, such as attention or working memory, that provide differential support for sentence-level processes than word-internal ones (???). Future studies should also explore the extent to which lexical and age-related processes are shaped, either independently or in tandem, by features of the learning environments that children experience (e.g., Weisleder and Fernald 2013). Questions about the nature of morphosyntactic representations in early language have often seemed deadlocked. But by mapping out developmental change across large samples and multiple languages, our findings here challenge theories across the full range of perspectives to more fully describe the mechanistic factors underlying the interaction of vocabulary, grammar, and development.

Putative variations in style of development are more problematic, because they raise questions about the order in which structures are acquired, and the mechanisms used to acquire those structures. (Bates et al. 1994) In an early report on individual differences in vocabulary acquisition, Nelson (1973) noticed that there was substantial variation in how many nouns “referential” (more than 50% nouns) - more object-focused, found to be less syntactically complex - faster vocabulary growth “expressive” (less than 50% nouns) - more self-focused, more syntactically complex structure and strategy, referential vs. expressive distinction Bates et al.

Here is proportion nouns as a function of total vocab size. Test Nelson (1973)’s suggestion that more referential is related to faster vocab growth. How do we do this? Well, one way of cashing out the relationship says that prop nouns should be a predictor of vocab size within language, over and above age? Not sure about the model to use here. First, try linear model of proportions (wrong). Now try glm over total outcomes. Model is largely the same, more overconfident but harder to interpret. In both cases, there’s clear support for Nelson (1973)’s R/E distinction in that kids with larger noun biases early tend also to have bigger vocabularies for their age. This is true fro all languages except for Mandarin, which doesn’t show a noun bias at all. Interestingly, it’s true in Cantonese too. Odd. On the other hand, that might just be a consequence of reverse causality: the bigger your vocabulary is, the bigger your noun bias on average, so you might just be picking up on the fact that kids with bigger vocabularies are showing the noun bias that would emerge later for every kid anyway. This is the critique leveled by Pine and Lieven (1990). One way to deal with this is to find out if a kid has a greater than vocabulary-size adjusted noun bias. What that looks like: OK, it’s a lot less obviously true that Rs have bigger vocabs than Es, at least by this analysis. 15.2.2 Closed class words In analysing the correlates of closed-class style, we found some limited evidence in support of a link between rate of development (i,e. precocity) and closed-class proportion scores… 15.3 Overlap in vocabulary Mayor and Plunkett (2014) create several procedures for examining idiosyncrasy of vocabulary. We are able to use the most direct one because of the accessibility of full item-wise data. This direct measure is computed by calculating the mean Euclidean distance between individual vocabularies and the mean vocabulary, where each word is either understood/produced (coded as 1 in a vector containing all words on the CDI) or not understood/not produced (coded as 0). As this metric is heavily dependent on the total number of words known on the CDI, these mean Euclidean distances are then normalized by the underlying binomial distribution, produced by measuring the Euclidean distance when vector values are drawn at random. The Normalized Euclidean Distance (NED hereafter) is computed according to the following equation: \\[NED = \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in N} \\sum_{j \\in W} (x_{ij} - p_i)^2}{\\sum_{i \\in N} \\sum_{j \\in W} (y_{ij} - q_i)^2}\\] where \\(W\\) refers to the number of words on the CDI, \\(N\\) the number of infants, \\(x_{ij}\\) is equal to 1 if the word \\(i\\) is understood/produced by infant \\(j\\) and 0 otherwise. \\(p_i\\) corresponds to the fraction of infants that understand/ produce word \\(i\\). \\(y_{ij}\\) corresponds to the random assignment to word \\(i\\) in run \\(j\\), where 1 and 0 are assigned randomly so that mean vocabularies match and \\(q_i\\) corresponds to the fraction of runs for which word \\(i\\) is understood/produced. I take \\(y_{ij}\\) to be a permutation of words within vocabularies. 15.4 Are there spurts in language growth?

["theory.html", "16 Conclusions 16.1 Summary Observations 16.2 Consistency in Variability 16.3 Limitations 16.4 Concluding Remarks", " 16 Conclusions In the preceding chapters, we have have presented evidence from a wide range of analyses of the Wordbank dataset. These analyses have revealed both striking variability across our units of sampling – children, primarily, but also words and even languages – but they have also revealed substantial consistency. In this conclusion we discuss the interplay and tension between these two ideas, variability and consistency, and how they interact with and inform theoretical conceptions of language acquisition more broadly. 16.1 Summary Observations 16.1.1 Variability Beginning with the first monograph reporting the CDI norming study, L. Fenson et al. (1994) noted that variability is perhaps the primary and most striking fact about children’s vocabulary learning. In Chapter 4, we quantified this variability and found that – across languages and spanning children’s second year – the variability was as large as the central tendency. In practical terms, the huge variance across children accounts for the fact that while some typically-developing two year olds will talk your ear off, others will barely utter a handful of words (even if they understand more). From a biological perspective, this variability is quite unprecedented. As a comparison, variation in heights for toddlers is tiny compared with variation in vocabulary: the mean height for a 24-month-old is around 33 inches, with a standard deviation of a little more than an inch, leading to a coefficient of variation around .03. This measurement is almost two orders of magnitude smaller than the coefficient of variation on vocabulary. 16.1.2 Consistency How can we describe and explain this variability? While much of the variance in the distribution of children remains unexplained, we still observe some striking correlates that can provide In this sense, our work here follows what we might call the “Batesian program,” the use of large-N data from the CDI to identify consistent developmental patterns that give clues to the organization of the mechanisms of language acquisition. To provide grounding to our discussion, we review consistencies below: Demographic differences. In Chapter 4, we explored demographic differences in vocabulary. With very limited exceptions, we see a consistent advantage for girls over boys in early word learning across languages. Similarly, across (a smaller set of) languages, children with earlier birth orders are reported to have larger vocabularies. Both of these demographic differences should be considered in light of the probability of reporting biases – for example, parents might expect girls to have larger vocabularies and hence report more words on average (though perhaps the consistency of the female advantage is surprising given variation in gender biases and stereotypes across countries, e.g., Nosek et al. 2009). We return to the issue of difficulties in causal inference below. Coefficient of Variation Variability across kids (size of the fan) FIXME Category biases. In Chapter 6, we extend previous work (e.g., Bornstein et al. 2004) by quantifying the degree of bias for and against different word classes in early vocabulary. For example, with a handful of exceptions (discussed in depth in that chapter) we see a bias for the overrepresentation of nouns in early vocabulary, at the expense of predicates and, even more so, function words. Individual words. Following Tardif et al. (2008), we show that there are large similarities in the most common early words. Further, we show that the predictors of what words are easier and harder across langauges are extremely consistent. Grammar and the lexicon. Following Bates and Goodman (1997), we show the tight developmental correlations between the growth of grammatical complexity in children’s early language and the growth of their vocabulary. 16.1.3 Limitations So what do these data tell us? 16.1.4 Ruling out methodological alternatives One important class of explanations that limits our ability to make generalizations is explanations of our observations that rely on data regarding the process of gathering CDI data itself, whether they relate to: the design process for the CDI, e.g., biases on the selection of words to be included in a form; the sampling process for families, e.g., biases on backgrounds of families within and across samples; the reporting process, e.g., biases regarding particular types of children (e.g., girls) or particular types of words (e.g., function words); To rule out these explanations, we need to rely on the existence of converging evidence for the same effects from other sources. Some of these sources are cited in the original chapters, but we briefly review them here. Gender [Probably in the original CDI/gender paper, look for references?] Birth order [??] Noun bias [bornstein study, others cited in that chapter?] Grammar/Lexicon [??] Predictor consistency (at least Huttenlocher et al. 1991, maybe others for frequency. harder for babiness, etc.) In sum, for many of our proposed consistencies, we can begin to muster evidence against them from convergent sources. Nevertheless, much more work is needed to measure the size (not just the direction) of these effects and compare effect size across different measurements. For example, if the same size gender effect were found in the same population with both parent report and pointing-based methods, this finding would provide evidence against a parent-reporting bias account of gender differences. This high standard has yet to be met for most of the findings we report. 16.2 Consistency in Variability Assuming that we can rule out reporting biases, 16.3 Limitations All of our analyses are fundamentally correlational. No causal inferences from Wordbank data are possible. We’ll say this again so you know we mean it: no causal inferences are possible. All of the consistencies described above admit alternative causal explanations. For example, as noted, parents could think that girls speak more and hence report more words for girls. Or girls could actually know more words. Similarly, first-born children could receive more language input due to the lack of other competition for parents’ attention, and hence have larger vocabulary. Or parents could be aware of more of first-born children’s vocabulary. Or both. As in the gender case, external data can provide evidence for or against particular causal explanations but in their absence we are left to speculate. For more cognitive consistencies that we observe, alternative causal interpretations are again possible. To take one example, the “noun bias” could result from any of the following causal mechansisms (as well as mixtures of these, or mixtures of these and others not described): * children could learn nouns more easily due to their social/referential disambiguation relative to the syntactic disambiguation (L. Gleitman 1990; Gillette et al. 1999); * they could be learned more easily due to their conceptual transparency (???); * they could be reported more frequently by parents due to some feature, such as their imageability or concreteness; * etc. Nevertheless, an observed pattern of correlations can still create a target for theory. Theorizing in language acquisition has traditionally argued on the axes defined by the nativist/empiricist debate, as well as the debate between domain-general and domain-specific representations and mechanisms. We label the implied axis of the debate here as the continuum between domain-general, empiricist theories and domain-specific, nativist theories. Anchoring one side of this continuum are statistical learning theories, that posit that domain-general mechanisms that learn structure from continuous input can induce structure from linguistic input [CITES: rethinking innateness, etc.]. On the other side are content-nativist theories that posit language-specific representational structures, such as the Principles and Parameters theory (Chomsky 1981, M. C. Baker (2005)). For all the reasons described above, we do not believe that the observed consistencies directly bear on traditional questions of the mechanisms underlying language acquisition. Taking the correlation between grammar and the lexicon as a case study: theoretical proposals from many parts of the space shown in Figure 2.1 can account for these data. For example, a purely bottom-up statistical generalization mechanism would clearly produce a correlation between lexical and grammatical structure (as in Bates and Goodman 1997’s original propopsal); statistical generalizations require lexical data and so more data should correlate with more generalization. But a more domain-specific nativist grammatical proposal might also produce this correlation, provided that it required triggering data (e.g., ???, (???)). And many variations in between. the consistencies we observe across languages point to putative universals: generalizations that hold across very disparate populations of human children learning typologically distinct languages. Surely such universals should be an important basis for theorizing about language acquisition. A theory that accounted for such universals “for free” – as a result of basic assumptions about the nature of the learning mechansisms – would be able to claim more and broader evidence, for example. 16.3.1 Speculations about Process What sort of developmental process of vocabulary learning could lead to these universals? Any claim of this sort must be very speculative. If pushed, we would point to the following (weak) proposals regarding processes that are consistent with some of our putative universals. Demographic differences are – at least – consistent with interactional-input theories of vocabulary development (Hart and Risley 1995,Hoff (2003),Weisleder and Fernald (2013)) in which the more and higher-quality the input the child receives, the faster vocabulary grows. Under this hypothesis, first-born, female, and higher-maternal education children all are likely to receive more and higher-quality input: female children through the route of their somewhat greater social/interactional abilities (an extra assumption), first-born children through their greater allocation of parent attention, and high maternal-education children through greater parental awareness of the role of input, differering parental practices, and greater amount of leisure time to spend with children among other factors. Both the noun bias and the age-of-acquisition prediction results are consistent with the broader cross-situational viewpoint on acquisition (L. Smith and Yu 2008,L. Gleitman (1990)). On this view, nouns are easy to learn because the more they are heard, the more opportunities children get to build consistent mappings between the words and their referents. In contrast, verbs and other predicates rely more on a base of nouns and a basic comprehension of the syntactic structures in which they appear in order to infer meaning in context. Thus they should be acquired relatively later and with relativel more support from shorter, easier-to-parse utterances (MLU as a predictor, for example). Cross-linguistic exceptions will tend to be for languages like Mandarin where many early-learned verbs are semantically-transparent enough to be learned cross-situationally. Correlations between grammar and the lexicon, as well as the greater role of MLU in predicting acquisition of function words are both consistent with views that posit gradual syntactic abstraction and generalization. Versions of such viewpoints exist throughout the broad theoretical space of language acquisition (???,Tomasello (2003),Meylan et al. (2017)), but all proposals rely on a learning mechanism in which generalizations about structure are graded and rely on the amount of evidence available. 16.4 Concluding Remarks Wordbank embodies our belief that scale is in itself transformative. The existence of a noun bias is a fascinating observation, but this observation gives limited leverage to differentiate theories. The magnitude of a noun bias provides more leverage for quantiative theorizing. And the distribution of magnitudes across many of the world’s languages gives greater leverage still. Our hope is that, by generalizing and applying many influential analyses by many contributors, our work here can affect theory more broadly. More ABOUT POWER TO MEASURE MEAN AND VARIANCE Developmental psychology often appears to be divided between two groups that do not communicate with one another. On the one hand, there are researchers interested in the ontogenetic and phylogenetic origins of knowledge – the epistemological project of understanding how we reason about objects, communicate using language, or learn from other people (???, (???), (???)). On the other hand, there are researchers interested in growth, change, and variation across individuals in psychometric constructs like executive function, working memory, and personality (???, other cites). The first type of research has led to a productive union of philosophical and psychological ideas, addressing many of the most exciting questions in the history of philosophy using empirical methods (???, (???)). The second type has had success in its connections to educational policy (???,(???), others?). In many areas of research, these two traditions have little interchange with one another. They read different journals, record different measures, use different research designs and statisical models, and often appear to be pursuing entirely different goals. Yet language learning is an area where these traditions come together. The knowledge being acquired – the stock of words in the child’s lexicon – is both the epistemic construct whose origins we are studying and the psychometric construct whose reliability across individuals we wish to assess. By studying the variability and consistency in the early lexcion, we can both study the origins of knowledge and the processes and factors by which human beings differ from one another across different cultural contexts, family environments, and genetic endowments.

["appendix-psychometrics.html", "C Psychometric Properties of the CDI C.1 Preliminary Estimation C.2 Item effects in WS C.3 Production and comprehension C.4 Properties by lexical category", " C Psychometric Properties of the CDI In this Appendix, we examine the psychometric properties of the CDI through the lens of Item Response Theory (IRT). In brief, IRT provides a set of models for estimating the measurement properties of tests consisting of multiple items. These models assume that individuals vary on some latent trait, and that each item in a test measures this latent trait (see F. B. Baker 2001 for detailed introduction). IRT models vary in their parameterization. In the simplest (Rasch) IRT model, each item has a difficulty parameter that controls how likely a test-taker with a particular ability will be to get a correct answer. In the more sophisticated two-parameter model, each item also has a discrimination parameter that controls how much response probabilities vary with varying abilities. Good items will tend to have high discrimination parameters across a range of difficulties so as to identify test-takers at a range of abilities. IRT models are a useful tool for constructing and evaluating CDI instruments, as they can help to identify items that perform poorly in estimating underlying ability. For example, WEBER et al. (2018) used IRT to identify poorly-performing items in a CDI instrument for Wolof (a language spoken in Senegal). IRT can also be used in the construction in computer-adaptive testing (Makransky et al. 2016). This appendix examines IRT models as a window into the psychometric properties of the CDI. In the first section, we explore latent factor scores using the English WS data. In the second section, we examine individual items and find generally positive measurement properties, although with some items at ceiling (included via carry-over from the Words and Gestures form). In the third section, we look at differences between comprehension and production in the WG form. In the fourth section, we look at the properties of the instrument by word category in both WS and WG. Overall, the conclusions of our analysis are that: Latent factor scores may have some advantages relative to raw scores in capturing individuals’ abilities, but for the purposes of the analyses we perform in the main body of the manuscript, they may carry some risks as well; hence we do not adopt them more generally. In general, CDI WS items tend to perform well, but from a pure psychometric perspective there are a number of items that could be removed from the English WS form. Comprehension items in general tend to have less discrimination than production, suggesting that they are not as clear indicators of children’s underlying abilities. Function words tend to have lower discrimination than other items but the lexical class differences are not huge and do not interact with whether they are measured using production vs. comprehension. C.1 Preliminary Estimation Practically, we use the mirt package (???,Chalmers and others (2016)) to estimate the parameters of a four-parameter IRT model. The four-parameter model supplements the standard two-parameter model with two parameters corresponding to floor and ceiling performance for a particular item. Items with high rates of guessing or universal acceptance across test takers would tend to have abnormal values on these bounds. Our goal in this first analysis is simply to examine parameter estimates across individuals and items. We begin by estimating this model with data from 5492 from the English (American) WG dataset. We first examine the histograms of latent ability scores and compare them with chronological age (because sampling is non-uniform) and raw production scores. As can be seen above, latent ability shows a peak in the middle of the range and generally fewer cases distributed at floor and ceiling. This shift indicates first, that floor and ceiling effects in the form are partially rectified by the model, and second, that many children in the middle of the form’s range are not well-distinguished from one another. One question regarding these scores is whether they should be used in place of proportion scores for some of the estimation problems we encounter throughout the rest of the book. These latent ability scores might be overall better reflections of children’s vocabulary than raw proportions in the best case. Nevertheless, we do not adopt them, for two reasons. First, they do not perform better empirically. The analysis above shows gender differences (cf. Chapter @ref(#demographics)) by both measures. Surprisingly, there appear to be limited differences in the curves recovered by the analyses. For example, for raw production, the coefficient of variation across age in the gender differences is 0.6. For the latent ability estimates, the CV is 0.64. Thus, based on the assumption that gender differences are constant across age, there is no evidence for better measurement. Of course, this assumption may be wrong, but this analysis does not yield evidence in favor of adoption. (Perhaps a smaller sample might yield different results; it could be that raw scores are stable due to the large amount of data in this analysis). Second, there are other negatives associated with swapping an imperfect but straightforward measure (raw scores) to a model-derived measure (latent ability). Interpretation clearly suffers if we use the model-derived measure, since readers will not be able to map scores back to actual behavior in terms of the checklist. In addition, model estimation issues across instruments introduce further difficulties in interpretation. Most obviously model estimates with smaller datasets may vary in unpredictable ways; similarly, the presence of poorly-performing items (see below) in certain datasets may lead to systematic issues in the latent estimates for those datasets. C.2 Item effects in WS Our next analysis examines items in the same WS dataset. The plot above shows item discrimination and difficulty, with outlying items labeled. Visual inspection shows a long tail of items with limited discrimination and low difficulty (e.g., mommy, ball, bye, etc.). These are clearly those items that are produced by nearly all of the children in the sample – they do not discriminate because they are passed by all children in the sample. If the only goal of the instrument were discrimination of different ability levels, they could likely be removed. On the lower right hand side of the plot, the remainder of items are clumped, with discrimination above zero and somewhat higher difficulty. The right-hand tip of this triangle shows the most diagnostic words (e.g., run, kitchen, and table), all of which effectively distinguish between the upper and lower groups of children in the sample. Finally, at the bottom of this triangle is a large cluster of words that are quite difficult. Some of these do not show good discrimination (e.g., country), since it is likely too difficult for nearly all children in the sample. We can follow up on the question of word inclusion by examining the distribution of discrimination parameters alone. Overall, this plot suggests that there are some items that could be dropped without major penalty. In particular, along with the very easy words in the left tail, there is a large cluster of words that are perhaps too difficult to be useful for most children. As a separate check on this analysis, we can examine the upper and lower bounds estimated for particular words. These bounds show words that are known by only a small number of children at ceiling or have a very high floor (respectively). Examining those with a very low ceiling, we see items that are likely to be quite idiosyncratic, for a variety of reasons. For example, babysitter, camping, and basement likely vary by children’s home experiences (further mediated by access to resources, parenting practices, and circumstances). In contrast, genital items (e.g. vagina*) vary by gender (see Chapter 10). Examining those items with a very high base rate shows a similar set to those with very low discrimination patterns, suggesting that the four-parameter model may have fit these words as having a high chance level with essentially no discrimination ability. Finally, we see items like grrr, woof woof, moo, and yum yum. These items show limited development across the age range of the instrument. Although most parents report children saying yum yum early, it is likely that some families either do not say yum yum or do not report it on the form as a signal of gustatory pleasure (perhaps because their 30-month-old already says delicious). C.3 Production and comprehension We next use IRT to estimate whether there are differences between production and comprehension, using WG data. The plot above shows IRT parameter values for discrimination and difficulty for production and comprehension (a few extreme parameter values are truncated in the plot for ease of seeing general trends). There are clear distribution differences on both measures. Difficulty is much higher (negative values) for production relative to comprehension, reflecting the expected asymmetry. We also see clear evidence that in general comprehension items show less discrimination, consistent with the hypothesis that production behavior is a clearer signal of children’s underlying knowledge than assumed comprehension. This pattern is visible in two ways. First, discrimination values are negative for more items in comprehension, indicating items that are not measuring ability. Second, and more importantly, mean discrimination is substantially lower for comprehension relative to production (1.1 vs. 1.8). Very few comprehension items have discrimination is greater than 2. This pattern of findings – lower discrimination values for comprehension – could be due to at least two possibilities. One is that parents are better reporters of production than comprehension, and hence these items are more discriminative of true behavior. The source of error in this case would be parents’ mistaken belief that their child understands a word. The second is that comprehension is a fundamentally more variable construct and that, hence, individual word knowledge consistent with understanding could be due to partial knowledge. Here the source of error is variance in how well children know the meanings of words. We cannot distinguish between these two models, but they have very different underlying implications for the CDI. On the first model, comprehension is simply hard to measure with parent report. On the second, comprehension is perhaps a richer and more nuanced behavior than production. C.4 Properties by lexical category One hypothesis that we have often speculated about is the question of whether there are special psychometric issues with particular word classes. For example, do parents struggle especially to identify whether children produce or understand function words? The plot above reproduces the WG by-item analyses above but with color given by lexical class. Many of the easy, non-discriminating items are found in the “other” section. In contrast, the hardest items tend to be function words. These items tend to have lower discrimination on average (1.3) compared with nouns (1.8), adjectives (1.9), and especially verbs (2.1). Nevertheless, the situation is not dire: most have a discrimination parameter above one. Thus, although function words are not the most discriminative items on the CDI WS, these items still appear to encode valid signal about children’s abilities. In our last analysis, we turn to the WG data. The plot above shows the mean and standard deviation for discrimination parameter values. In production, the higher discrimination shown on the whole (above) is likely due to the strong performance of nouns. In contrast, mean discrimination for other words is low. This pattern may be due to the overall sparsity of early production data for non-noun items. In comprehension, in contrast, there is a moderate level of discrimination for all classes except “other” (which includes items like mommy and daddy and a variety of animal sounds and social routines). One hypothesis about this finding is that, especially early on, parents are very generous in their interpretation of whether their child understands these words. In sum, we do not find evidence that function words are particularly bad. Rather, there are some low-performing items spread across all categories of the CDI form, and many of these likely perform poorly for the reasons described above – especially difficulty in interpretation of very early behavior and variability in home experience.

D.2 Form Stitching We can “stitch” across WS and WG forms to get a fuller picture of production across ages. There are several ways to accomplish this.

Now apply this more broadly. Note that the 50% point for logistic regression = \\(- \\beta_1 / \\beta_2\\). arm::bayesglm is working very well here, basically moving Mommy and Daddy a bit more conservative but otherwise preserving most of the curve. arm::bayesglm with these made-up parameters fixes some of the issues, produces a better-looking distribution with fewer crazy outliers.

The first uses the parametric form of the logistic to fill in low-frequency words that are not on the CDI, the second uses the difference between diary study counts and CDI counts to find a multiplier for higher-frequency words that are omitted. I think there’s a bit of a conceptual issue here, as these two corrections should essentially be the same thing - there are some words that are not on the CDI, and more of these are the low frequency/hard words. So really, it all is a correction for missing words. Also - the first correction, which depends on the parametric form of the logistic, is much much smaller than the second. Take a look at this. Equation 3: \\[ p(w_i) = 1 - \\frac{1}{1 + e^{\\frac{-(i-a)}{b}}} \\] So adding the gray area gives us \\[ V_{corr_1} = b \\log (1 + e^(a / b)) \\] but then adding the second correction is just a multiplier on this: \\[ V_{corr_2} = \\alpha * V_{corr_1} \\] Note that (strikingly), M&amp;P2011 never give their value of \\(\\alpha\\) in the text. I estimate it below so that I can make an estimate of what correction 2 actually looks like… So you can see that the second correction dwarfs the first correction in size, and is really based on a few small diary studies. In sum, I’m worried about this model for a few reasons: The distributional form (logit) is clearly not correct, so using this distributional form for extrapolation may have bad consequences. The first and second corrections aren’t conceptually distinct: they both concern missing words. Both have to do with the sampling of words on the CDI from the broader vocabulary. The second correction, which does most of the work, is - for reasonable reasons of data etc.- assumed to be a strict multiplier, which makes it do a ton of work at the higher end of vocabulary. "],
