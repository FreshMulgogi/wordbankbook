These analyses have revealed both striking variability across our units of sampling – children, primarily, but also words and even languages – but they have also revealed substantial consistency. In this conclusion we discuss the interplay and tension between these two ideas, variability and consistency, and how they interact with and inform theoretical conceptions of language acquisition more broadly. 10.1 Summary Observations 10.1.1 Variability Beginning with the first monograph reporting the CDI norming study, Fenson et al. (1994) noted that variability is perhaps the primary and most striking fact about children’s vocabulary learning. In Chapter 3, we quantified this variability and found that – across languages and spanning children’s second year – the variability was as large as the central tendency. In practical terms, the huge variance across children accounts for the fact that while some typically-developing two year olds will talk your ear off, others will barely utter a handful of words (even if they understand more). From a biological perspective, this variability is quite unprecedented. As a comparison, variation in heights for toddlers is tiny compared with variation in vocabulary: the mean height for a 24-month-old is around 33 inches, with a standard deviation of a little more than an inch, leading to a coefficient of variation around .03. This measurement is almost two orders of magnitude smaller than the coefficient of variation on vocabulary. 10.1.2 Consistency How can we describe and explain this variability? While much of the variance in the distribution of children remains unexplained, we still observe some striking correlates that can provide In this sense, our work here follows what we might call the “Batesian program,” the use of large-N data from the CDI to identify consistent developmental patterns that give clues to the organization of the mechanisms of language acquisition. To provide grounding to our discussion, we review consistencies below: Demographic differences. In Chapter 3, we explored demographic differences in vocabulary. With very limited exceptions, we see a consistent advantage for girls over boys in early word learning across languages. Similarly, across (a smaller set of) languages, children with earlier birth orders are reported to have larger vocabularies. Both of these demographic differences should be considered in light of the probability of reporting biases – for example, parents might expect girls to have larger vocabularies and hence report more words on average (though perhaps the consistency of the female advantage is surprising given variation in gender biases and stereotypes across countries, e.g., Nosek et al. 2009). We return to the issue of difficulties in causal inference below. Category biases. In Chapter 4, we extend previous work (e.g., Bornstein et al. 2004) by quantifying the degree of bias for and against different word classes in early vocabulary. For example, with a handful of exceptions (discussed in depth in that chapter) we see a bias for the overrepresentation of nouns in early vocabulary, at the expense of predicates and, even more so, function words. Individual words. Following Tardif et al. (2008), we show that there are large similarities in the most common early words. Further, we show that the predictors of what words are easier and harder across langauges are extremely consistent. Grammar and the lexicon. Following E. Bates and Goodman (1997), we show the tight developmental correlations between the growth of grammatical complexity in children’s early language and the growth of their vocabulary. 10.1.3 Limitations All of our analyses are fundamentally correlational. No causal inferences from Wordbank data are possible. We’ll say this again so you know we mean it: no causal inferences are possible. All of the consistencies described above admit alternative causal explanations. For example, as noted, parents could think that girls speak more and hence report more words for girls. Or girls could actually know more words. Similarly, first-born children could receive more language input due to the lack of other competition for parents’ attention, and hence have larger vocabulary. Or parents could be aware of more of first-born children’s vocabulary. Or both. As in the gender case, external data can provide evidence for or against particular causal explanations but in their absence we are left to speculate. For more cognitive consistencies that we observe, alternative causal interpretations are again possible. To take one example, the “noun bias” could result from any of the following causal mechansisms (as well as mixtures of these, or mixtures of these and others not described): * children could learn nouns more easily due to their social/referential disambiguation relative to the syntactic disambiguation (L. Gleitman 1990; Gillette et al. 1999); * they could be learned more easily due to their conceptual transparency (???); * they could be reported more frequently by parents due to some feature, such as their imageability or concreteness; * etc. Nevertheless, an observed pattern of correlations can still create a target for theory. As we noted in the introduction, observing what “hangs together” in development can provide clues to the underlying system (???). We think of these correlations as loose targets for theorists: a successful theory can gain support by providing an account for these observations. But what kinds of theories can these observations differentiate? Figure 10.1: A caricature of the traditional theoretical space in langauge acquisition research. Theorizing in language acquisition has traditionally argued on the axes defined by the nativist/empiricist debate, as well as the debate between domain-general and domain-specific representations and mechanisms. We label the implied axis of the debate here as the continuum between domain-general, empiricist theories and domain-specific, nativist theories. Anchoring one side of this continuum are statistical learning theories, that posit that domain-general mechanisms that learn structure from continuous input can induce structure from linguistic input [CITES: rethinking innateness, etc.]. On the other side are content-nativist theories that posit language-specific representational structures, such as the Principles and Parameters theory (Chomsky 1981, Baker (2005)). For all the reasons described above, we do not believe that the observed consistencies directly bear on traditional questions of the mechanisms underlying language acquisition. Taking the correlation between grammar and the lexicon as a case study: theoretical proposals from many parts of the space shown in Figure 10.1 can account for these data. For example, a purely bottom-up statistical generalization mechanism would clearly produce a correlation between lexical and grammatical structure (as in E. Bates and Goodman 1997’s original propopsal); statistical generalizations require lexical data and so more data should correlate with more generalization. But a more domain-specific nativist grammatical proposal might also produce this correlation, provided that it required triggering data (e.g., ???, (???)). And many variations in between. So what do these data tell us? 10.1.4 Ruling out methodological alternatives One important class of explanations that limits our ability to make generalizations is explanations of our observations that rely on data regarding the process of gathering CDI data itself, whether they relate to: the design process for the CDI, e.g., the selection of words to be included in a form, the sampling process for families, e.g., the lack of Gender Birth order Noun bias Grammar/Lexicon Predictor consistency 10.2 Process Universals Assuming that we can rule out reporting causes, the consistencies we observe across languages point to putative universals: generalizations that hold across very disparate populations of human children learning typologically distinct languages. Surely such universals should be an important basis for theorizing about What is the nature of these universals? By virtue of the learning problem that they arise from, they cannot be universals of content. What are the alternative Alternative hypotheses: 1. content universals: 2. process universals 3. unique and idiosyncratic developmental trajectories Claims of universals should always be taken with a grain of salt. In our case, a variety of caveats apply, from the relatively limited sample size N = 25 (see Piantadosi and Gibson 2014 for guidance on claims about strict universals) to the strong Indo-European bias amongst the languages in the database. At best our claim is of a statistical universal rather than an absolute universal. In addition, nearly all of our data come from populations in relatively industrialized nations (cf. Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan 2010). 10.3 Concluding Remarks Developmental psychology often appears to be divided between two groups that do not communicate with one another. On the one hand, there are researchers interested in the ontogenetic and phylogenetic origins of knowledge – the epistemological project of understanding how we reason about objects, communicate using language, or learn from other people (???, (???), (???)). On the other hand, there are researchers interested in growth, change, and variation across individuals in psychometric constructs like executive function, working memory, and personality (???, other cites). The first type of research has led to a productive union of philosophical and psychological ideas, addressing many of the most exciting questions in the history of philosophy using empirical methods (???, (???)). The second type has In many areas of research, these two traditions have little interchange with one another. They read different journals, record different measures, use different research designs and statisical models, and often appear to be pursuing entirely different goals. Yet language learning is an area where these goals Wordbank embodies our belief that scale is in itself transformative. The existence of a noun bias is a fascinating observation, but this observation gives no leverage "]
