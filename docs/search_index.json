To what extent do different children and children learning different languages follow the same path into language? To what extent are these paths variable or idiosyncratic? These questions about the consistency and variability of early language lead directly into the central questions of language acquisition: What, if any, are the universal mechanisms that lead to the emergence of human language? Answering these questions is complicated immensely by the fact that there is no one single event that constitutes language acquisition. Early language learning involves the accumulation of thousands of words, grammatical rules, and constructions, and takes place over the course of years of growth and millions of separate interactions. This problem of timescales makes measurement a tremendous challenge. In addition, during the period in which language emerges, language ability varies wildly from child to child and most children are at best reluctant experimental participants. These two observations mean that accurate measurement of language development across individuals is a major challenge. Parent report is one powerful method for adressing these. The MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CDI) is a simple survey instrument for measuring early language outcomes that was designed to address these issues.1 The CDI is a checklist for parents to fill out to report on their child’s progress in language. In different versions of the form, parents mark whether their child “says” or “says and understands” particular words out of a list of several hundred. Separate sections for gestures, word forms, and grammar are also present in some versions. Despite their simplicity, over the past 25 years of use, CDI forms have been shown to be reliable and valid measures of children’s early language. In addition, CDI forms have been adapted to more than 90 different languages around the world. Research based on the CDI has contributed tremendously to our understanding of the growth of language in early childhood. In this book, we examine the question of variability and consistency in early language through the lens of the CDI. This book is a product of the Wordbank project (M. C. Frank et al. 2016), which has as its goal to archive CDI data in a structured format so that it can be explored and analyzed in the service of describing vocabulary acquisition. The database currently contains data from more than 78787 CDI form administrations across 28 languages. Wordbank is also continuously growing as new researchers contribute data. We believe this database is the largest and most diverse set of data on early language acquisition currently in existence. Over the course of our work with Wordbank, we have developed a consistent framework for representing and analyzing CDI data. This framework allows us to unify a variety of influential previous analyses of CDI data. Just to take an example, one question of theoretical interest has been whether young children have an over-representation of nouns (names for things) in their vocabulary, and whether this trend is seen across languages. In Chapter 5, we develop an analytic method for measuring the size of this “noun bias” and apply the analysis to the Wordbank data. This measurement can then be compared across languages, and its variability can be estimated and compared to other measurements. Thus, one first contribution of this book is to synthesize and unify previous work. Research in early language learning often builds off a fragmentary empirical picture, in which many important theoretical conclusions are based on analyses of transcripts from a small number of children, or analyses of CDI data from English learners only. We hope that bringing together a large set of analyses of vocabulary data and implementing them consistently, openly, and reproducibly on the same dataset will help to create an empirical starting point for future work. A second contribution of the book is to develop theory treating the question of consistency and variability in early language. We develop the notion of “process universals” – that some aspects of the process of word learning may be universal across cultures and may lead to similarities in the dynamics of learning. These universals may arise due to the basic mechanisms of learning, memory, and social cognition that are at play in early vocabulary learning. This notion of process universals has a long history in the field (by Bates, Slobin and others), but the Wordbank project provides an opportunity to lend new empirical data and analytic power to these ideas. This notion is contrasted with notions of “content” or “structural” universals in which particular principles regarding the structure of languages are innately given. Outline of the Book Although our goal is a full exploration of the phenomena of child language acquisition, the analyses we report are constrained by the structure of the data in Wordbank. At its heart, the individual instrument datasets stored in Wordbank are matrices of item by child data. Considering the data in this way (shown in Figure @ref(1_outline_diagram)), leads to a number of obvious data analytic strategies, many of which correspond directly to previous approaches to CDI data. (#fig:1_outline_diagram)A graphical outline of the book. For example, averaging across items leads to by-child averages, where each child receives a comprehension or production score. Chapter 3 considers this view of the data, examining predictors of individual children’s vocabulary. Of course, chief among these is age, and developmental growth patterns as well as variability in development is considered in the first part of this chapter. But beyond age, even the limited demographic data available in Wordbank can be used to explore the data. In Chapter @ref{demographics}, we report the ways that vocabulary growth varies across gender, birth order, and maternal education (a rough but cross-cultually valid proxy for socio-economic status). These demographic predictors reveal both consistent and variable patterns across languages: while gender and birth-order effects more relatively constant, socio-economic effects vary widely in magnitude. Averaging across the other margin of the data leads to by-item averages. These can be examined in a number of different ways. First, items can be grouped into categories (both syntactic and semantic). Chapter 5 considers the categorical composition of early vocabulary, giving special consideration to the “noun bias” that is found in many – but not all – of the languages in Wordbank. Chapter 6 adopts the same approach for semantic, rather than syntactic, categories. Chapter 7 considers the growth trajectories for individual words and adopts the approach of predicting the trajectories of individual words based on both environmental and conceptual features of these words. This last approach calls for the incorporation of other resources, and so we use a variety of English and cross-linguistic resources to supplement Wordbank data in this chapter. Not all items denote individual words, however, so in Chapters 10 and 11, we consider the gesture/communication and grammatical items that are included in some CDI forms. Chapter 10 follows up on the early work of Fenson et al. (1994) who explored the relationship between gesture and early vocabulary. Chapter 11 explores the work of Bates and Goodman (1999) and Marchman and Bates (1994), who considered the relationship between vocabulary growth and the growth of grammar and first reported the striking relationship between these variables. Both of these chapters (as well as the rest of the book) are deeply indebted to the Batesian vision of exploring the process of language learning. The book ends with two empirical synthesis chapters. Chapter @ref{style} returns to the question of individual variation using tools built up in previous chapters to quantify differences in the style and trajectory of learning across children. And the final substantive chapter, Chapter @ref{theory}, synthesizes observations across languages for the preceding chapters to create an empirical definition for “process universals.” How to Read This Book You can read this book as a narrative monograph. If you intend to do so, we recommend you read Chapters @ref{intro} and @ref{methods} before moving on to substantive chapters of interest. We also recommend you read our theoretical synthesis in Chapter @ref{theory}. You can also read this book as a reference. If you take this approach, just dive into any chapter that is of interest, knowing that you may need to use some of the terminology defined in Chapter @ref{methods} to interpret the constructs and analyses that are used. Many of the analyses reported here were first described in earlier publications (e.g., M. C. Frank et al. 2016,M. Braginsky et al. (2015),Braginsky et al. (n.d.)). Rather than reprinting these verbatim, this manuscript updates them using the unified analytic approach and larger dataset described in Chapter 2. The version of these analyses represented in the manuscript should be considered more definitive than any previously published or presented version. Static Book, Dynamic Data The dataset in Wordbank is constantly growing and changing as we add new features, new data, and new languages. In addition, as users of the data occasionally identify issues and errors, we make will make corrections to the database. In writing this manuscript, we have attempted to find a middle ground between a completely dynamic document that responds to any change in the database on the one hand and a traditional, static book on the other. A static manuscript would be a shame given the potential for dynamic extension and updating with new data. On the other hand, if the data were completely dynamic, any claim we made in prose would risk being out of date almost as soon as we wrote it. For this reason, we work using snapshots of the underlying database. Every so often, we will return to the manuscript and recompile the online edition, then check references to the data that might have changed. This build of the book is based on FIXME DATE.
