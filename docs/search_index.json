All the AOA curves. Let’s compare methods. C.1 Empirical quantiles First try empirical quantiles. This loses many observations that never go above 50%. C.2 Basic GLM Now let’s try the basic GLM version. Compare. The GLM AOA gives some very early values, but it is OK with a lot of data (as in the case of English). C.3 Robust GLM Looks totally reasonable except for the two crazy ones. #&gt; [1] &quot;daddy*&quot; &quot;mommy*&quot; C.4 Bayes GLM Can we do a BayesGLM to regularize things a bit? Let’s explore a single curve. Basically, BayesGLM does exactly the same thing as GLM because of the huge amount of data, no matter what prior. Let’s try also robust GLM. Now apply this more broadly. Note that the 50% point for logistic regression = \\(- \\beta_1 / \\beta_2\\). BayesGLM is working very well here, basically moving Mommy and Daddy a bit more conservative but otherwise preserving most of the curve. BayesGLM with these made-up parameters fixes some of the issues, produces a better-looking distribution with fewer crazy outliers. C.5 Hierarchical GLM model Set some stan settings. The model. Constraints: No negative slopes - we don’t get worse at words. Strong prior on slopes, they should have mean and sd around .25 (empirical) Much weaker prior on intercepts, though yoked their SDs (perhaps too tightly? Now reformat the data to stan format and compute. #&gt; In file included from file73f081a0f7d.cpp:8: #&gt; In file included from /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.4/Resources/library/StanHeaders/include/src/stan/model/model_header.hpp:4: #&gt;

C.6 Full comparison between models Merge with previous data frame. AOA distribution Plot. And pairs plots. C.7 Sparsity simulations BGLM with fairly restricted priors appeared to perform well, giving us reasonably constrained estimates for early words and otherwise being very correlated with glm and the more computation-heavy hglm. One consideration remains: does it perform well with very sparse data? Examples of this process with 100 children actually look much stronger overall. ## Conclusion BayesGLM with hand-tuned priors seems to perform pretty well. To Do: * Test with WG comprehension * Test with another language "]
