We call this combination “stitching.” This appendix provides some motivation for the practice. A.1 Item Stitching For arbitrary items, stitching across English WS and WG tends to look pretty good. A.2 Form Stitching We can “stitch” across WS and WG forms to get a fuller picture of production across ages. There are several ways to accomplish this. The simplest is to use proportions for each form. This isn’t particularly good. You can also stitch item by item, this is trickier but better. A.3 Item-Level Form Stitching "]
