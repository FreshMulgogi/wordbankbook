["appendix-variability.html", "B Measures of Variability", " B Measures of Variability In Chapter @ref{vocab}, we switch between parametric and non-parametric measures of variability (CV vs. MADM) and Cohenâ€™s \\(d\\) vs. MMAD. Here we show that these are very similar in the limit with a large amount of data, although they can produce quite different answers for individual data points, especially those that are at the floor or ceiling of the particular form.
