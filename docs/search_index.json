These analyses have revealed both striking variability across our units of sampling – children, primarily, but also words and even languages – but they have also reealed substantial consistency. In this synthetic chapter we begin by presenting a set of analyses of the consistency and variability of specific phenomena. We then discuss the interplay and tension between these two ideas, variability and consistency, and how they interact with and inform theoretical conceptions of language acquisition more broadly. 15.1 Measuring variability and consistency In each of the substantive chapters of this book (roughly speaking from Chapter 5 to 14), we have presented analyses of specific phenomena of theoretical interest. Wherever possible, we have generalized these analyses across languages so that their relative consistency can be examimined and discussed. The goal of the current analysis is to bring together these analyses into a single meta-analysis (in the general sense, not the specific statistical sense). This strategy executes the general idea discussed in Chapter 1: Our chapterss have identified “signatures” of language development, measurements that we believe are theoretically interesting or central. We then quantify these signatures and their variation across languages. The resulting numbers represent an empirically-derived measure of which aspects of language development are more similar across different languages and contexts. We discuss the types of inferences licensed – and not licensed – by these analyses below. 15.1.1 Methods We begin by identifing a small number of measures computed in each chapter to serve as the “signatures” to be promoted into this analysis. For each measure, we compute its cross-linguistic variability using a standardized measure of variance, the coefficient of variation (CV, the standard deviation divided by the mean). This measure can range from 0 (indicating a phenomenon that is completely invariant across languages) to infinity (with higher numbers indicating greater variation). These CV values provide a single common measure to allow comparability of otherwise very different quantities, allowing inferences across analyses and datasets – albeit with some cautions that we describe below. Each measure for which we compute the CV will have both a different base unit and a different number of languages contributing. For example, when considering the correlation between grammar and the lexicon (Chapter 13), we will be looking at the CV of a set of correlations with one specific set of languages contributing. In contrast, when we look at the size of the noun bias (Chapter 11), we will be looking at a group of bias estimates that have different units and a different set of languages. Thus, caution is warranted in interpreting these variability estimates, even though we believe that they indeed are informative. To assist in interpretation, we exclude measures that can be computed in fewer than 7 languages; provide the N contributing languages for all analyses; and compute an estimate of the standard error of the CV (\\(SEM \\approx CV / \\sqrt{2N}\\)). The set of signatures we include in this analysis are necessarily a subjectively-determined subset of the possible measures we have examined in the book. And of course those in turn are a subset of the measures we could have computed. Wherever possible we have attepted to make reasonable decisions, but some of these are by necessity somewhat arbitrary. An example of such a decision comes from the summary of Chapter 5. In that chapter we noted that population variability appears quite consistent across languages. We summarised population variability in production via a statistic, MMAD – but what is the appropriate range of ages to include in a single estimate? In this chapter, we observed that there appears to be a ceiling effect in the later ages. Thus, we decided to include variability in production from 12 – 24 months. But this decision is data-dependent and so of course there is a risk of circularity. We point the issue out not to undermine this particular analysis; we believe the ceiling effect is quite clear and other aspects of the age choice do not lead to much change in the CV estimate. Rather we intend to highlight that the summary we give is not a theory-neutral estimate but rather a “best guess” – an attempt to navigate the myriad choices involved in our analysis in a reasonable way. One example of such a choice is that we have made the decision to omit estimates of early production from WG-type forms. Our judgment was motivated by the fact that such estimates are routinely quite noisy and difficult to interpret, likely due to the sparsity of early production. In chapter after chapter, we found unreliable or uninterpretable results that are plausibly due to data sparsity; thus, we choose to omit these patterns. 15.1.2 Results and Discussion Figure 15.1: Coefficient of variation across languages for signatures of language development corresponding to four different categories (panels). Each point gives an estimate, with point size corresponding to number of languages. Color indicates whether comprehension or production is measured. Error bars give the standard error of the coefficient of variation. Figure 15.1 shows the coefficient of variation across languages for all measures in each of these categories. For the sake of our analysis, we have divided measures from the preceding chapters into four categories, corresponding to the panels of Figure 15.1. These are: Measures of the composition of vocabulary, from Chapters 11 and 12. These measures describe the over- and under-representation of various word categories in vocabulary. The units over which CV is computed are bias scoresl; these are bounded from -.5 to .5 (deviation from unbiased acquisition of a particular category). Predictors of word difficulty, from Chapter 10. The consistency of different regression predictors of age of acquisition are here represented by their cross-linguistic consistency. This analysis is distinct from the analysis presented in that chapter (which focused mostly on the magnitude rather than variability of the coefficients themselves). Despite that, we include it here for comparison with other signatures. The units over which CV is computed are standardized regression coefficients. Relational measures, from Chapters 7 and 13. These measures are originally correlations between vocabulary size and other aspects of early language. Vocabulary signatures, from Chapters 5 and 6. These measures document patterns in the overall size of vocabulary across individuals and demographic groups. The original units are themselves variability-based (MMAD scores). A number of local patterns are immediately apparent; we discuss these briefly below before turning to larger-scale generalizations in the next section. First, comprehension is almost always more variable than production, even when a comparable number of languages are included. The only obvious exception to this regularity is for coefficient weights on arousal in the Predictors category – and we can discount this example: arousal was on average one of the weakest predictors of acquisition order overall. Why would comprehension be more variable across languages than production, especially given evidence that comprehension vocabulary tends to be less idiosyncratic than production (Mayor and Plunkett 2014)? One strong possibility is the psychometric properties of comprehension vs. production reports. As described in Chapter 4, while comprehension scores are likely still a reliable and valid index of children’s abilities in the aggregate, individual comprehension questions tend to carry less information. Thus, there may simply be more noise in these measurements, leading to less cross-linguistic stability. This regularity illustrates a point we have made earlier and will return to below: the inferences from consistency and variability are asymmetric. In the case of consistency, we can make relatively strong inferences about some kind of shared process or mechanism. In contrast, in the case of variability, there are many sources of variance (including measurement error) that can account for a specific pattern of performance. Second, relational measures are highly invariant across languages. These relations include correlations between the size of children’s lexicon (in production or comprehension) and their gesture, morphology, and grammatical complexity. These findings can be measured in a relatively small set of languages (due to limited data availability for the gesture and complexity items on the form). Nevertheless, the high level of consistency is striking. Third, demographic predictors – birth order, maternal education, and sex – are somewhat variable, likely reflecting at least some cultural variation. The most variable of these is the relation of maternal education with vocabulary. Maternal education is plausibly a proxy for socioeconomic status (SES); in turn the relation of SES to vocabulary is likely mediated by many local- and national-level policies including access to childcare, parent leave, pre- and post-partum education and services. Thus, we view variation on this dimention as highly plausible a priori. In contrast, as we asserted in Chapter 5, the consistency of children’s variability is quite striking: the variability of children across instruments is almost completely constant, especailly for production. Around the world, toddlers appear to be have similar levels of variability in their level of production. Finally, while predictors of word difficulty are consistent relative to a chance baseline (see Chapter 10), they are also on the higher end of variability. Especially in comparison to some of the relational signatures (e.g., the correlation between grammatical complexity and vocabulary), their variability is high. Plausibly some of this variability is due to additional variation added to these estimates by the use of external resources (e.g., corpus counts). In particular, as we discussed in that earlier chapter, there is an unknown amount of noise added by estimating frequencies from smaller-scale cross-linguistic corpora. 15.2 Generalizations What is the picture of language development that emerges from the analysis above? In this section we return to the theoretical project of Chapter 1, which was to use patterns of consistency and variability to provide constraints on theories of early language learning. We begin by considering three major generalizations from our data, and then turn back to the question of possible learning processes that could support these generalizations. 15.2.1 The language system is tightly woven It could easily be the case that children are “pointy” with respect to language – that is, highly proficient in some sub-aspect of languages and poor at others. A naive examiner of a group of children in a toddler classroom might conclude that the variation that they observed was supportive of such a view. In such a classroom, some children will only be able to gesture and say a few words; while some others will appear to show a large noun bias; and still others will be fluently combining words. Furthermore, these children will be distributed across a range of ages, with this progress only somewhat predicted by relative age (especially in a tightly-grouped sample from say 18–30 months). This viewpoint is incorrect, however. Instead, the language system is tightly woven together, such that on the whole children who are good at gesture have larger vocabulary, and children who have larger vocabulary also inflect and combine words more proficiently. These correlations within individuals are large and they are universal across those languages in which we can evaluate them. Further, while these correlations could in principle arise in CDI data from parent reporting bias across sections of a single form, they are largely borne out in a variety of observational and behavioral datasets (e.g., Brinchmann, Braeken, and Lyster 2018; Rowe and Goldin-Meadow 2009). How can the consistence and coherence of these distinct aspects of early language be reconciled with the type of variation our preschool observer might see? Consider the following model of early language. The first posit of this model is that the trajectory of children’s learning follows a single, coherent path through the stages of early language. Initially, gestures and early nouns and social routines are learned. Nouns follow, leading into verbs. Verbs in turn promote word combination and morphology. The second posit is that aspects of this trajectory may be non-linear: the noun bias increases and then decreases (Bates et al. 1994); the relation between lexicon and grammar may be flatter at one period than another (Dixon and Marchman 2007). Finally, imagine a third posit: this non-linear trajectory is followed at different rates, with a child’s current state partially a function of age and partially a function of their own idiosycratic learning rate. Under such a “unitary non-linear trajectory” model, we would still see “pointy” children in the preschool classroom. These children would be cross-sections cut from the same trajectory, but at different points along it. The younger child who knows a surprising number of names might be further along relative to age and hence firmly in the “noun bias” part of the general path. In contrast, the older child who primarily gestures might be a child with a slightly slower growth rate. Observed variation need not indicate that the subparts of language do not “hang together” (to return to the Batesian phrasing). We return below to the analyses of true variation in learning style that are reported in Chapter 14). Alongside its support from the cross-linguistic consistency in cross-domain correlations, this unitary view of early language is supported by several other bodies of wrok. The first is a set of longitudinal analyses by Bornstein and colleagues. In a two-cohort longitudinal study, Bornstein and Haynes (1998) and Bornstein, Hahn, and Haynes (2004) collected data from a sample of American English learning children at two and four years and measured language using a variety of instruments including parent report, transcripts, and behavioral tasks. In a re-analysis of these data, Bornstein and Putnick (2012) found that the core construct of early languaeg that emerged from the sub-measures was both highly correlated with each of the sub measures and also highly stable over time (as we noted earlier in Chapter 4). In addition, research on international adoption, a unique case study of changes in learning rate relative to input, provides support for this unitary trajectory view as well. International adoptees often have to let go of their native language copletely, sometimes at a fairly old age, and begin learning a host language. A body of work by Snedeker, Geren, and Shafto (Snedeker, Geren, and Shafto 2007; Snedeker, Geren, and Shafto 2012) suggests that these children go through the same general course of acquisition, including an early noun bias and early gramamtical omissions, but they did so much more quickly on average then native learners. Although these children were more conceptually sophisticated and could learn faster, the informational challenges of breaking into the language were still similar on the whole. In sum, the language system is tightly woven or perhaps even unitary in nature. Although our data provided multiple opportunities for aspects of language development (communication, vocabulary, morphology, grammar) to pull apart across individuals into modular subsystems, they instad hung together very tightly. Further, the strength of these connections did not vary across every language examined: the nature of the trajectory was surprisingly consistent, even across languages with substantial differences in morphosyntactic structure. 15.2.2 Content similarities in early language The content of children’s early language is strikingly similar across languages, both in the specific words they learn and the general categories that are over-represented in their vocabularies. These foci likely emerge from a combination of children’s particular attention and interests; the communicative priorities of child-caregiver dyads; and the informational structure of language, which renders certain aspects of langauge easier to learn than others. Interest- conceptual - priorities - not just frequency - drive content of vocab - semantic bias - no function words - same order of acquisition Dyadic interest and focus - very consistent across cultures “Not doing nuclear physics with a two-year-old” Snedeker adoption stuff - is it the learning problem or the cognitive (is it about the structure of language) color/time/adjectives? 15.2.3 Children take different routes into language Despite these aggregate similarities across children and across cultures, children individually take different routes into language. The speed with which they acquire language is highly variable in the first years of life and this variability itself is a constant across cultures. Further, children vary stably in the nature of their acquisition path, soem naming more objects and others combing words relatively more. Different routes into language Variably is a constant variability is endogenous referential/expressive distinction check longitudinal stability 15.3 Learning processes In Chapter 1, we introduced the idea of “process universals.” These cannot be universals of content as all of the content being reported by parents filling CDI forms is language-specific. Intead, the idea of process universals is that there are processes that operate in different language context to produce the observed pattern of phenomena. These processes could be – but need not be – learner-internal. They could also operate at the level of the child-caregiver dyad, for example. In what follows, we move away from the term “universal.” Although in principle our theoretical goal is process universals, in practice thelimitations of the analysis above are such that we can only speak about “consistent processes.” Not only do we have a maximum of 43 distinct language/instrument samples represented in any estimate, we have a maximum of 29 languages or dialects in any analysis (and often considerably fewer) . This sample, while strong in terms of the within-language estimates, is only a weak start in terms of cross-language estimates (see Piantadosi and Gibson 2014 for guidance on claims about strict universals). Further, there is a strong Indo-European and WEIRD (western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic) bias amongst the languages in the database (Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan 2010). Thus, some consistencies that we observe are probably conditioned on environmental consistencies as well as dyadic and child-internal processes. In the remainder of this chapter, we speculate on some of these. So what sort of developmental process of vocabulary learning could lead to these universals? Any claim of this sort must be very speculative. If pushed, we would point to the following (weak) proposals regarding processes that are consistent with some of our putative universals. Demographic differences are – at least – consistent with interactional-input theories of vocabulary development (Hart and Risley 1995; Hoff 2003; Weisleder and Fernald 2013) in which the more and higher-quality the input the child receives, the faster vocabulary grows. Under this hypothesis, first-born, female, and higher-maternal education children all are likely to receive more and higher-quality input: female children through the route of their somewhat greater social/interactional abilities (an extra assumption), first-born children through their greater allocation of parent attention, and high maternal-education children through greater parental awareness of the role of input, differering parental practices, and greater amount of leisure time to spend with children among other factors. Both the noun bias and the age-of-acquisition prediction results are consistent with the broader cross-situational viewpoint on acquisition (Smith and Yu 2008; Gleitman 1990). On this view, nouns are easy to learn because the more they are heard, the more opportunities children get to build consistent mappings between the words and their referents. In contrast, verbs and other predicates rely more on a base of nouns and a basic comprehension of the syntactic structures in which they appear in order to infer meaning in context. Thus they should be acquired relatively later and with relativel more support from shorter, easier-to-parse utterances (MLU as a predictor, for example). Cross-linguistic exceptions will tend to be for languages like Mandarin where many early-learned verbs are semantically-transparent enough to be learned cross-situationally. Correlations between grammar and the lexicon, as well as the greater role of MLU in predicting acquisition of function words are both consistent with views that posit gradual syntactic abstraction and generalization. Versions of such viewpoints exist throughout the broad theoretical space of language acquisition (Yang 2016; Tomasello 2003; Meylan et al. 2017), but all proposals rely on a learning mechanism in which generalizations about structure are graded and rely on the amount of evidence available.
