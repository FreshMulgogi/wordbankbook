Parent report is one powerful method for investigating. The developers of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory forms (CDIs) created a set of instruments for providing a broad overview of children’s language.1 This book is a dynamic document that summarises descriptive patterns and theoretical conclusions from the examination of a large database of CDI data through the Wordbank project (Frank et al. 2016). 1.1 Theories of Language Acquisition There are many approaches to studying language learning. We distinguish a couple of major touchstones theories so that we can refer back to them. Theories of vocabulary acquisition: Constraints and Biases (Markman 1990) Cross-situational Learning (Yu and Smith 2007) Theories of grammatical acquisition: Constructivist Principles and Parameters 1.2 The MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory The original norming study. (???) 1.2.1 Measurement Properties Decent reliability and validity for English. Need to review other evidence on this. 1.2.2 Cross-linguistic Approach Adaptation, not translation! 1.3 The Wordbank Project Overview of our efforts to archive existing datasets 1.4 Organization of our Analyses Our analyses are organized by different ways of cutting our data: Vocabulary: total numbers of words said or understood by individuals, examined via demographic and longitudinal methods. Word categories: What word categories are learned earlier or later? How do these patterns vary across languages? Individual words: What words are learned earlier or later? Are there demographic or category differences in words? Grammatical items: How does grammatical complexity change across development? How is it related to the growth of the lexicon? Gesture items: How does gesture relate to early language? But, we also discuss cross-cutting theoretical themes for each analysis. 1.5 Theoretical Themes of our Analyses Variation: Children vary tremendously. What predicts that variation? Consistency: Are there theoretical Placeholder "]
