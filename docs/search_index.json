Words and Sentences 4.1.3 Comparions of Variability on Comprehension and Production 4.2 Demographic Variables We examine the patterns of vocabulary growth for individual demographic variables. To make these analyses work, we assume that all demographics interact with age in a simple way in the models, such that there is only one coefficient associated with the effect: age * demographic - demographic All of these analyses are carried out on production data. 4.2.1 Gender This analysis examines how vocabulary development differs by children’s reported gender, replicating and extending the results of: Eriksson, M., Marschik, P. B., Tulviste, T., Almgren, M., Pérez Pereira, M., Wehberg, S., … Gallego, C. (2012). Differences between girls and boys in emerging language skills: Evidence from 10 language communities. British Journal of Developmental Psychology 30, 326–343. An earlier version of this analysis was reported in Frank et al. (2016). Plot vocabulary size over age by gender. 4.2.2 Maternal education We use maternal education as a proxy for socio-economic status. 4.2.3 Birth order Only 7 languages have birth order data, and only 5 languages have it for WS. 4.2.4 Demographic effect sizes How can we compare the size of these different demographic effects? One simple way to do so is to integrate the area between curves. The units for this analysis are arbitrary and (right now) can’t be compared across languages, since the curves have different lengths. To overcome this limitation, we’d need to look at First look at gender advantage. Visualizing demographic advantages against one another. "]
