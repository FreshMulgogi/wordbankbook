Putative variations in style of development are more problematic, because they raise questions about the order in which structures are acquired, and the mechanisms used to acquire those structures. (Bates et al. 1994) Preceeding chapters have dealt with the degree of variability between individuals in Chapter 5 and the stability of individuals’ learning in Chapter 4. Then Chapters 6 and 9 used demographic factors to explain variability. In general, our treatment of variability has focused on issues of learning rate in the sense discussed by Bates et al. in the quote above (or, to be more precise, vocabulary size). With the exception of Chapter 9, which examined the rate of learning individual words, we have not dealt yet with issues of style. What does it mean for two children to show differences in language learning style? Intuitively, some aspect of the learning process should differ. Unfortunately, from the data that we use here, we cannot observe process – we can only observe the outcome of learning: knowledge. Thus, children must exhibit some differences in the way their vocabulary grows. This difference could be distributional and inferred indirectly from cross-sectional data or it could be shown directly through longitudinal data (though this move limits the number of datasets we can use from Wordbank). One prominent candidate for a stylistic difference in language acquisition is the distinction between “referential” and “expressive” children. In an early report on individual differences in vocabulary acquisition, Nelson (1973) noticed that there was substantial variation in how many nouns children had in thir vocabulary. She called children who had more than half of their vocabulary devoted to nouns “referential” children. They tended to have speech that was less syntactically complex and showed faster vocabulary growth. In contrast, “expressive” children had speech that was more syntactically complex and had fewer nouns. Dore (1974) proposed a related version of this distinction, focusing on speech acts from two children in the middle of the second year and labeling them as “code oriented” (focused on labeling, similar to “referential”) vs. “message oriented” (instrumental, social requests, similar to “expressive”). Since this seminal work, the referential/expressive distinction has become enshrined in the literature as a canonical aspect of variation in children’s style. Yet further debate about the consequences of this stylistic distinction continued in the literature. For example, Bates, Bretherton, and Snyder (1988) observed a correlation between the proportion of nouns in the children’s vocabulary and their vocabulary size and suggested the possibility that a referential style might be more effective for learning. Reacting to this claim, Pine and Lieven (1990) argued that the direction of causality might be reversed, however: perhaps having a bigger vocabulary (at least at a certain point) would lead to a greater representation for nouns.6 While exploring the referential/expressive phenomenon more rigorously, Bates et al. (1994) presented analyses largely supporting that view: much systematic variation in the “referentiality” (proportion nouns) in children’s vocabularies was due to the size of their vocabulary. As children’s vocabularies grow, they tends to increase in their over-representation of nouns (as shown also in Chapter 11). Thus, two children of the same age who have different proportions of nouns may also have different overall vocabulary sizes. After controlling for this factor, Bates et al. (1994) found only more limited evidence for stylistic variation. In the first subsection of this chapter, we pick up these analyses and apply them broadly to our dataset. A second area of stylistic variation that has been much discussed is whether some children go through a vocabulary “spurt,” defined as a change in the rate of vocabulary growth. The idea of a “spurt” or “explosion” occurs in a wide variety of discussions of early vocabulary (e.g., Nelson 1973; Kamhi 1986; Bates, Bretherton, and Snyder 1988, see e.g., Dapretto and Bjork (2000) for review). Clearly, from the average growth rates observed in Chapter 5, children’s vocabulary growth accelerates dramatically during the period following first birthday and the emergence of production. Investigations of this acceleration have focused on two distinct features: its variation across children and its explanation. Although there has been a tremendous amount of discussion of explanations for accelerations in vocabulary growth, we will not investigate this topic further here. Our data not allow us to investigate issues of mechanistic process directly. In addition, a short but convincing analysis by McMurray (2007) suggests that such acceleration is over-determined in the sense that it will likely emerge from almost any plausible mechanism acquisition mechanisms. Assuming that words vary in difficulty as a normal distribution, vocabulary growth will naturally accelerate with increases in a child’s ability. Thus, making reverse inferences from the presence of acceleration to a particular mechanism is unwarranted. The second issue – variation in acceleration – is related our aim here, however. Does every child’s vocabulary acceleration follow the same general pattern, or is there substantial variation in the type of growth that is followed, for example in the point at which acceleration begins, or the specific shape of the growth curve? Ganger and Brent (2004) report a systematic study of a subpart of this issue: whether there is a discontinuity in growth rate for individual children. Definining a spurt specifically as a change in the rate of acceleration, they conduct a quantitative analysis of whether such a change occurs. Our second set of analyses follows up on this general issue. The final area of stylistic variation that we address in our third subsection is the question of whether there are some children who are more fluent producers vs. others who have a large vocabulary in comprehension but more limited production. At the clinical extreme significant variation in this respect must be present, because there are some children with various apraxias of speech that have strong comprehension but serious production difficulties. The question is whether, in a typically developing population, we can detect systematic variation on this dimension. 15.1 Variation in Vocabulary Composition In this subsection we examine the question of variation across children in referential vs. expressive vocabulary. Following Bates et al. (1994), we operationalize the notion of a “referential” vocabulary as one that has a greater proportion of nouns relative to other classes (the definition of “noun” is the same here as in Chapter 11. While there might be other more nuanced measures that we could construct, this one has the advantage of being directly related to the framework in Chapter 11; thus, we use that same framework to investigate vocabulary composition in individuals here. The proportion of children’s vocabulary that is made up of nouns is shown in the figure above. There is a general trend for an over-representation of nouns, as shown by the blue line (representing the smoothed mean proportion nouns) being above the red dashed line (total porportion nouns on the form). The size of this over-representation is the topic of Chapter 11. Here we examine its variability across children. Is a referential style associated with having a larger vocabulary? The proportion of nouns in a child’s vocabulary should then be a predictor of vocabulary size, over and above age. A simple model of this hypothesis is a GLM predicting the number of CDI words a child produces as a function of age and proportion nouns.7 The coefficients of such a model, fit to the data from each language, are shown above. Age coefficients are positive, indicating more words with age. Proportion of nouns is also negative, indicating that having more nouns is related to a smaller vocabulary, controlling for age. (Standard errors are plotted, but are typically tiny and hence invisible.) This result appears to provide support for the opposite to the claimed relationship between the referential/expressive distinction and vocabulary size. Those children with more referential vocabularies have smaller vocabularies, controlling for age. The trouble is that these variables – age, noun bias, and total vocabulary size – have a complex relationship to one another. For a young child, having a bigger noun bias is correlated with having a bigger vocabulary (because they are on the early part of the “noun over-representation” curve shown in Chapter ??). In contrast, for an older child, having a bigger noun bias is correlated with having a smaller vocabulary because they are on the later part of the curve. Thus, the directionality of the relationship that you discover is largely determined by what part of your sample is densest. Put another way, proportion nouns could be predictive of vocabulary size not because children with a particular style have bigger vocabularies, but because having more nouns in your vocabulary tends to indicate that you are further along a standard prorgession. Put another way, perhaps all children follow the same trajectory through the noun bias. Even in this scenario, knowing the size of a child’s noun bias will tell you something about vocabulary size, without that implying that the child is following a different trajectory. This point is made in different ways by both Bates et al. (1994) and Lieven, Pine, and Barnes (1992). One way to circumvent this critique statistically is to measure whether a particular child has a greater-than-average, vocabulary-adjusted noun-bias. In other words, if we remove the average correlation with noun bias and vocabulary, can we still find a relation with individuals’ degree of noun bias and vocabulary size? The figure above shows both the English noun-proportion data (plotted now by vocabulary size) and the residuals of that distribution when fit via a cubic model (blue curve). The next question we can ask is how this “residualized style” relates to other variables like age, grammatical ability, and (in longitudinal data) further vocabulary growth. Note that we cannot compare this variable to other aspects of concurrent vocabulary size because features like, for example, number of closed class items in the vocabulary are non-independent (since the more nouns you have, by definition the fewer closed class items). Our first analysis looks at the correlation between vocabulary-residualized noun bias and age. The plot above shows coefficient estimates on this analysis. Now most age coefficients are reliably negative, suggesting that a greater residual noun bias is associated with being younger. Two of the main outliers here are from Mandarin, which, as discussed in Chapter ??, has the smallest noun bias of any of the languages in our dataset. Next we examine correlations with grammatical ability. Lieven, Pine, and Barnes (1992) was interested in the possibility that an alternative route into language from a referential style would be the use of construction-based generalizations. For grammatical complexity scores, we see that vocabulary-residualized noun bias is reliably related to grammatical complexity. Because of the residualization procedure, this relationship is over and above the correlations between grammar and lexicon (as reported in Chapter 14). Thus, those children with more nouns than expected for their vocabulary size produce less complex language. (Again, Mandarin is an exception). As seen above, they are also younger than expected. We next repeat the analysis of complexity while controlling for age and total production. The coefficients are shown above. Production of course has a positive relationship to grammatical complexity, as does age (see Chapter 14). Even controlling for these two factors, howver, we still observe a consistent negative relationship between residual noun bias and complexity. Summarizing, we were interested in this subsection in whether we found cross-linguistic evidence for different strategies for language learing, in particular the referential vs. expressive distinction. Operationalizing this distinction, we asked whether children with a larger noun-bias show differences in their language learning trajectory than children a smaller one. The relationships between overall noun bias and vocabulary are complex to interpret due to the non-linear relationships between these variables and age. To circumvent this, we examined a residualized noun bias measure that controls for total vocabulary. This measure was related to age and to grammatical complexity: children with relatively more nouns in their vocabulary tended to be younger and to be producing less complex speech, across languages. Taken together, these data provide some cross-linguistic support for the idea that children show variability beyond differences in rate of vocabulary acqisition. One dimension of variability is that, for a particular level of vocabulary size, there appear to be children who are younger, know more nouns, and combine words less (perhaps the “referential” children referred to in previous literature); other children will tend to be older, have a more diverse vocabulary (including more predicates), and will tend to use these to combine words more. 15.2 “Spurts” in Vocabulary Perhaps the most obvious aspect of early vocabulary is that it picks up speed over the second year after birth. First words are hard-won but soon children’s language appears to “explode.” This acceleration is easily visible in the plot above, which shows the median productive vocabulary from 8 - 18 months (English (American) Words and Gestures data). (We could measure the rate of learning by taking the derivative of this curve; but this rate calculation is slightly misleading for cross-sectional data and so we postpone this analysis until below). This increase in the rate of vocabulary learning has been much remarked on in the literature, as discussed above. Our starting point here is a study by Ganger and Brent (2004), who provide a detailed, curve-fitting analysis of the question of vocabulary “spurts.” They evaluate whether individual children’s longitudinal growth patterns are better fit by a model with constant acceleration in growth rate, or whether some children have a discontinuous “step” in terms of their growth rate. In our view, this is a productive approach, but presupposes some descriptive facts about children’s growth rate generally. For example, using longitudinal data, we can simply examine features of rate and acceleration and how they change with time. For these analyses we focus on longitudional production data from Norwegian and English WS and WG forms. Because we are interested in computing (potentially non-linear) changes in rate, we need four datapoints from each child as a minimum, and because we are interested in early changes, we set the restriction that the first time-point reported should have fewer than 50 words reported (50 words is often used as a semi-arbitrary cutoff for the vocabulary spurt; Dapretto and Bjork 2000; Ganger and Brent 2004). The decision to exclude children with larger vocabularies at their first recorded measurement means that we have some bias present to include children with slower vocabulary growth. In particular, from the WS data we exclude a substantial proportion of children even from the youngest groups (e.g., 0.22% of Norwegian 16-month-old). So as not to bias the analysis further by including a large proportion of older, slower learners, we only include children younger than 21 months in this sample. We now have a population of children for whom we can evaluate the rate of vocabulary growth and how it varies as a function of age. This winnowing leaves us with data from 290 children, whose growth curves are shown in the figure above. We exclude datapoints associated with large decreases in vocabulary (negative rates). Although some small negatives would be expected based on measurement error or forgetting, large negative spikes are rare and likely due to errors in the data (e.g., a partially filled form). We exclude rates of -10 words/month and below (0% of data). The figure above shows the child’s estimated growth rate in the measurement period leading up to that month (number of words learned since the last longitudinal measurement divided by number of months since that measurement) plotted by total words produced in that month. There is a clear quadratic shape to this pattern, almost certainly caused by ceiling effects for children who are “running out of words” on the form. The question of vocabulary spurts, as posed by Ganger and Brent (2004), is the way that vocabulary growth rate increase for individual children. Clearly it increases (because vocabulary growth picks up speed generally) – but does it grow smoothly, indicating constant acceleration? Or does it move from one equilibrium to another (indicating an initial “spurt”)? Ganger and Brent (2004) propose analyzing children’s growth rate as a function not of age, but of total vocabulary. To examine this question, we need to focus in on the initial 250 words when the average rate appears to be increasing linearly (before ceiling effects are found; see red curve above), and identify children with more than 4 CDIs before this time (to ensure sufficient density). Further, we need to examine the rate trajectories of individual children. The plot above shows this analysis for a randomly sampled subset of children in our available datasets. Ganger and Brent (2004) analyzed the question of developmental spurts by fitting different curve types to the rate function in their data. They compared the likelihood ratio of quadratic and logistic rate curves for each child’s data. The quadratic curve represented the hypothesis of smooth growth in rate (smooth acceleration). In contrast, the logistic curve was of the form \\[R \\sim \\frac{\\alpha}{1 - e^{-\\beta (W - \\gamma)}}\\] where \\(R\\) is the rate of acceleration, and it is assumed to be distributed as a function of \\(\\alpha\\), the asymptotic rate, \\(\\beta\\), the slope of the change between the initial and final rates, \\(W\\) (the total vocabulary), and \\(\\gamma\\), the point at which the spurt occurs. This curve captures a discrete “spurt” – a movement from one equilibrium to another. We fit these functions (as well as a simple linear function) to our data. Fitted curves for children with more than 7 datapoints are shown above. The basic visual impression from these data is that, even with the longitudinal depth we have for individual children, there is substantial uncertainty in the best-fitting curve. However, it does not appear that there are many children who show something that looks clearly like a spurt. A few children rise quickly and then show one datapoint that levels off. But there is a puzzle. We can only confirm that the rate has leveled off if we have data at higher levels of production. But for vocabulary size over 300 words, every child will level off in their rate because they have “run out of words” on the form. This example illustrates some of the difficulties in making strong inferences from data of this type. We next conducted the full model comparison analysis that Ganger and Brent (2004) conducted, over the 0 separate longitudinal records included.8 In Ganger &amp; Brent’s analysis, they used only two models (linear and quadratic), which had the same number of parameter. Accordingly, they compared only the likelihoods of the data under these models. In contrast, we compared a linear function with intercept at 0 (1 parameter), standard linear (2 parameters), quadratic (3 parameter), and logistic (3 parameter) curves. To make up for the difference in parameters, we computed Akaike’s Information Criterion (a measure of model goodness of fit, where smaller is better) for each model for each participant. Dataset linear linear0 logistic quadratic English (American) WS 1 2 0 0 Norwegian WG 2 35 20 17 Norwegian WS 3 11 6 4 The table above shows the proportion of children in each dataset for which different model types fit best. Overall, children were split between models, with some children best fit by the logistic. The linear functions, which were simpler, however, fit more participants better, with the 1-parameter linear model with no intercept best fitting more children than any other. The 26 children (out of 101 total) with a best-fitting quadratic model are shown above. Some of these children do appear to have data that are well-fit by the quadratic model. But for many, this fit appears to be the product of a signle datapoint; assuming some error, a more parsimonious model (e.g. simple linear) might do just as well. Thus, with more children but less density, our conclusion tends to be similar to Ganger and Brent (2004): there is limited evidence for a vocabulary spurt in most children. To further examine this issue in a denser dataset, we used data from B. C. Roy et al. (2015)’s in-depth study of a single child. This is an ultra-dense dataset with millions of words of transcribed speech and hand-checked age-of-acquisition data for over 600 words up to the child’s second birthday. The comparable curves for this dataset are shown above. Using the same AIC method, the quadratic model fits best, but the linear model is clearly close as well. Stepping back, in this subsection we examined the growth rate of children’s vocabulary. To a first, group-wise approximation, children’s vocabulary growth accelerates linearly with vocabulary size during the initial period (up to around 250 words). After this point, we run into substantial measurement issues because the CDI does not contain enough words to be certain of the pattern of growth. Further, when we examined individuals’ growth, it also often appeared to be linear or quadratic; only in a minority of individuals was there any evidence for a “spurt” (a discrete change). This conclusion was tempered, however, by the difficulty of drawing conclusions without even denser longitudinal data concerning the very beginnings of language. 15.3 Variation in Production vs. Comprehension Our next investigation concerns the question of how tightly comprehension and production are yoked within CDI data. Our assumption is that there is variability between children on this dimension – while some children produce a large amount of language, others appear to produce less but still understand substantial amounts. How does the ratio of production to comprehension vary across ages, and across cultures? It is important to be clear that some of the pattern in this variable could be due to variation between parents in under- or over-reporting comprehension (or for that matter, production, but we assume – and Chapter 4 confirms – that production reports likely carries more signal). For example, we might be detecting variation in the threshold at which parents assume that a response indicates comprehension. Some parents might be very liberal and recall a generally-understood story that included a particular word, while others might be searching for a specific anecdote that clearly illustrates comprehension of that word. Of course this type of analysis can only be conducted on WG-type forms, because of the presence of comprehension information. We begin by investigating the American English WG data as an example. The figure above shows individual children’s comprehension and production plotted against one another. The diagonal indicates a child who comprehends and produces exactly the same number of words. In practice, this measure is always below the diagonal because by the design of the form, a child cannot “say but not understand” a particular word, they can only “understand” or “say and understand.” We can convert these data into a productivity ratio: \\[productivity = \\frac{\\# produced}{\\# understood}\\] and plot this ratio for all children. The resulting scatterplot is quite interpretable. It contains a few outliers at the very top of the range for very young children (whose parents report them producing and comprehending the same number of words). But for most others, the ratio is low, increasing from about 10% to 30% by the top of the form. The figure above plots these productivity ratios by language for an age-restricted subset between 8 and 18 months. Plots are sorted by the mean productivity ratio. While the majority of languages show the same pattern as English (an increase from around 10% to 30%) there are some outliers that show a flatter slope. We can see this pattern even better by plotting the best-fit lines across languages. Nearly all of these go up with age and have similar slopes. Going back to the scatter plots, however, in nearly every language to one degree or another, we see some number ratios &gt; .95, indicating that parents are essentially not using “understands” as a separate option. The table above shows the proportion of children showing more than 95% productivity. A number of samples have substantial proportions of parents reporting comprehension in this way. While it is possible that these numbers represent actual children whose production is synchronized with their comprehension, a more parsimonious explanation is that there are local variations in administration, leading to some fraction of parents not completing the form properly. In particular, it does not appear that these “no comprehension without production” children are the tail of a shifted distribution of productivity ratios; instead, they appear to be due to a separate small population. Yet despite that they appear to have an outsized effect on our estimates of the development of productivity ratios across languages. In sum, although the relationship between production and comprehension is a fascinating locus for individual differences, we may not be able to measure this relationship effectively using cross-linguistic comprehension data. Further, these analyses underscore the importance of instructions regarding comprehension in CDI administration. 15.4 Conclusions Summarizing the conclusions from our various different sub-analyses: The traditional referential vs. expressive distinction is supported by cross-linguistic analysis that suggests that, even at a given level of vocabulary size, some children tend to be younger, use more nouns, and combine less; others will tend to be older, know more predicates, and combine words more. Vocabulary growth is approximately linear for the first 250 words, and a “vocabulary spurt” is not reliably observed across most children (ratifying earlier work by Ganger and Brent 2004). It is tricky to use comprehension data to estimate variability between individuals in how much they produce vs. comprehend, due to likely cross-linguistic differences in the uptake of instructions regarding comprehension. Caught up in this discussion is the question of whether there is a route into language via the memorization of “frozen phrases.” This is an independent theoretical question that is difficult to address with CDI data as it is a question about the repetitive use of chunks of language in production. One observation is that, due to evidence of early verb generalization (e.g., Gertner, Fisher, and Eisengart 2006), the original discussion about limited generalization in children’s early syntax has been somewhat subsumed into a discussion about differences between general comprehension and conservative production.↩ We omit interactions from most of the models below for interpretability; including interactions leads to unstable coefficient estimates.↩ This number consolidates data between WG and WS forms when a child has both, to maximize our use of the available longitudinal data.↩ "]
