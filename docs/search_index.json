We begin by briefly reviewing the content of our findings across the preceding substantive chapters. Next, we discuss three synthetic generalizations from these findings. We then turn to the question of the particular process universals that might be compatible with this empirical picture. 16.1 Summary We began with the question of what parent report can tell us about children’s early language. We are now in a better position to answer this question, summarizing findings across the content chapters of the manuscript. In Chapter 4, we reviewed evidence for the reliability and validity of parent report instruments for assesssing children’s early language, with generally positive conclusions. Further, we contributed two sets of novel analyses. First, examining large-scale longitudinal datasets, we estimated the fall-off in test-retest correlations over developmental time, which suggested a relatively high level of reliability overall. Second, we used item response theory (IRT) models to examine the measurement properties of individual words on the CDI. Overall most items had strong psychometric performance, and even comprehension reports appeared to have consistent informational value about a child’s overall abilities (although individual items appeared less diagnostic on average than production reports). The broad picture from this chapter was positive, motivating further use of CDI data. Chapter 5 then examined trends in the growth and distribution of individual vocabulary estimates. Across languages, and for production and comprehension, early vocabulary starts slow and grows rapidly in the second year after birth. There are both absolute and relative differences between languages in the estimated rate of vocabularly growth, however. While some of these may reflect true differences (for example, Danish being famously difficult to acquire), others likely stem from differences in instrument, sample, and administration conditions. On the other hand, we observed a striking consistency across languages in the degree to which children varied. This finding suggests the operation of individual- and dyad-level processes that vary systematically in a way that is somewhat independent of the precise content being acquired and the cultural background of acquisition. On average, language emerges quickly - but despite the average pattern, toddlers around the world are “all over the place” in their learning rate. Chapter 6 considered demographic predictors of vocabulary size. We found a general female advantage in early vocabulary that was more pronounced for production than comprehension. This advantage did not appear to stem from reporting bias, and was relatively consistent in size across languaes. We also observed a first-born advantage and an advantage for children with more-educated mothers (likely a proxy for general socio-economic status). Chapter 9 followed up these analyses by identifying whether specific words were the locus of some of these differences. The conclusion of these analyses were that there were both general demographic differences in vocabulary and word-specific differences. For example, girls both on average have a higher probability of knowing any word, and they also have a much higher probability of knowing words like “dress” and “doll.” Turning to gestural communication, Chapter 7 showed that early gestures are both quite consistent with one another and quite consistent across languages. In other words, gestures appear to group together as part of a set of communicative abilities (rather than existing as isolated items). A small set of similar gestures are often the earliest emerging across languages, likely arising from relatively universal dyadic needs (e.g., a signal for “pick me up” or “give me”). Finally, early gestures are quite well correlated with early vocabulary within individuals. Like early gestures, early words are often surprisingly similar across languages. In Chapter 8, we quantified this similarity and showed that it was related to typological relatedness. On the other hand, even quite dissimilar languages had a good number of the same words in children’s earliest vocabulary. Like early gestures, these early vocabulary items likely reflect relatively universal communicative needs in infant-caregiver dyads (we return to this theme below in the section on Generalizations). In Chapter 10, we extended this approach to the composition of vocabulary by creating predictive models of the ease or difficulty of individual words. These models, uniquely in our analyses, take into account the average environmental input for a learner of a particular language (estimated from corpus resources). Although a number of factors including input, conceptual factors, and phonological complexity interact to predict when words are first produced, the profile of predictors across languages was quite similar. We interpret this finding to point to a relatively consistent set of processes that are operating in different linguistic contexts. Following the thread of cross-linguistic differences, Chapter 11 examined the question of the syntactic composition of vocabulary across early development. Consistent with previous reports, we found that most languages exhibited a bias towards nouns, although the strength of that bias varied across languages; further essentially all languages showed a developmental bias against function words. On the other hand, the bias for predicates (verbs and adjectives) was more variable across languages, with most languages showing a negative bias but a few (Mandarin and Cantonese, in particular) showing a neutral or positive bias. This pattern of variability points to some language-specific factors (perhaps syntactic structure, perhaps other linguistic or interactional factors) that influence learning within particular syntactic categories. We next applied this same approach to semantic categories (Chapter 12. Computing the relative bias for or against particular semantic categories, we found some cross-linguistic consistency in early biases: biases for body parts, games, and onomotopoiea were quite consistent; biases against words for places and time were as well. These biases suggest that there are likely some attentional and conceptual biases that facilitate or inihibit word learing in similar ways across languages. Turning next to syntactic development, Chapter 13 showed that children’s morphological and grammatical ability appears tightly coupled with their vocabulary size. This generalization holds very consistently across languages, validating Bates’ speculation that it is a general law of language development. This chapter also indentified a moderating effect of age on this relationship such that older children appear to gain more “units grammar” per “unit vocabulary” - that is, grammar emerges slightly faster for these older chilren. The last empirical chapter, Chapter 14, examined individual variability in language. This chapter presented evidence for the “referential” vs. “expressive” distinction – that, even controlling for overall developmental level, some children appear to have larger, “noun-ier” vocabularies while others have smaller vocabularies but combine words more. Similarly, some children certainly produce relatively more of their total vocabulary than others (though these measurements are difficult to validate independent of reporting variability). On the other hand, we did not observe strong evidence for the idea that some children undergo particular vocabulary “spurts” - rather, vocabulary growth appears to accelerate relatively smoothly once statistical artifacts are accounted for. Finally, in the previous chapter, Chapter 15, we attempted to consolidate the cross-linguistic variability in all of the findings above and place these on a single axis. This comparison revealed a number of patterns that we take up in our generalizations below. 16.2 Generalizations What is the picture of language development that emerges from these individual fidings? We now return to the theoretical project of Chapter 1, which was to use patterns of consistency and variability to provide constraints on theories of early language learning. We begin by considering three major generalizations from our data, and then turn back to the question of possible learning processes that could support these generalizations. 16.2.1 The language system is tightly woven It could easily be the case that children are “pointy” with respect to language – that is, highly proficient in some sub-aspect of languages and poor at others. A naive examiner of a group of children in a toddler classroom might conclude that the variation that they observed was supportive of such a view. In such a classroom, some children will only be able to gesture and say a few words; while some others will appear to show a large noun bias; and still others will be fluently combining words. Furthermore, these children will be distributed across a range of ages, with this progress only somewhat predicted by relative age (especially in a tightly-grouped sample from say 18–30 months). This viewpoint is incorrect, however. Instead, the language system is tightly woven together, such that on the whole children who are good at gesture have larger vocabulary, and children who have larger vocabulary also inflect and combine words more proficiently. These correlations within individuals are large and they are universal across those languages in which we can evaluate them. Further, while these correlations could in principle arise in CDI data from parent reporting bias across sections of a single form, they are largely borne out in a variety of observational and behavioral datasets (e.g., Brinchmann, Braeken, and Lyster 2018; Rowe and Goldin-Meadow 2009). How can the consistence and coherence of these distinct aspects of early language be reconciled with the type of variation our preschool observer might see? Consider the following model of early language. The first posit of this model is that the trajectory of children’s learning follows a single, coherent path through the stages of early language. Initially, gestures and early nouns and social routines are learned. Nouns follow, leading into verbs. Verbs in turn promote word combination and morphology. The second posit is that aspects of this trajectory may be non-linear: the noun bias increases and then decreases (Bates et al. 1994); the relation between lexicon and grammar may be flatter at one period than another (Dixon and Marchman 2007). Finally, imagine a third posit: this non-linear trajectory is followed at different rates, with a child’s current state partially a function of age and partially a function of their own idiosycratic learning rate. Under such a “unitary non-linear trajectory” model, we would still see “pointy” children in the preschool classroom. These children would be cross-sections cut from the same trajectory, but at different points along it. The younger child who knows a surprising number of names might be further along relative to age and hence firmly in the “noun bias” part of the general path. In contrast, the older child who primarily gestures might be a child with a slightly slower growth rate. Observed variation need not indicate that the subparts of language do not “hang together” (to return to the Batesian phrasing). We return below to the analyses of true variation in learning style that are reported in Chapter 14). Alongside its support from the cross-linguistic consistency in cross-domain correlations, this unitary view of early language is supported by several other bodies of wrok. The first is a set of longitudinal analyses by Bornstein and colleagues. In a two-cohort longitudinal study, Bornstein and Haynes (1998) and Bornstein, Hahn, and Haynes (2004) collected data from a sample of American English learning children at two and four years and measured language using a variety of instruments including parent report, transcripts, and behavioral tasks. In a re-analysis of these data, Bornstein and Putnick (2012) found that the core construct of early languaeg that emerged from the sub-measures was both highly correlated with each of the sub measures and also highly stable over time (as we noted earlier in Chapter 4). In addition, research on international adoption, a unique case study of changes in learning rate relative to input, provides support for this unitary trajectory view as well. International adoptees often have to let go of their native language copletely, sometimes at a fairly old age, and begin learning a host language. A body of work by Snedeker, Geren, and Shafto (Snedeker, Geren, and Shafto 2007; Snedeker, Geren, and Shafto 2012) suggests that these children go through the same general course of acquisition, including an early noun bias and early gramamtical omissions, but they did so much more quickly on average then native learners. Although these children were more conceptually sophisticated and could learn faster, the informational challenges of breaking into the language were still similar on the whole. In sum, the language system is tightly woven or perhaps even unitary in nature. Our work here confirms and extends previous investigations by Bates et al. (1994) and Bornstein and Putnick (2012). Although our data provided multiple opportunities for aspects of language development (communication, vocabulary, morphology, grammar) to pull apart across individuals into modular subsystems, they instad hung together very tightly. Further, the strength of these connections did not vary across every language examined: the nature of the trajectory was surprisingly consistent, even across languages with substantial differences in morphosyntactic structure. 16.2.2 Content similarities in early language A second broad generalization from our work here is the content similarities in children’s early vocabulary across languages. Put simply, regardless of the language they are learning, children in the early stages of language learning appear to talk about similar things, especially people, social routines, small objects, and body parts. This work built on work by Tardif et al. (2008), which compared the distribution of children’s first ten words across three languages. Many of the content generalizations that held for those three languages in fact hold much more broadly as well. We observed findinga related to this generalization in at least three aspects of our data analysis. First, relating most directly to Tardif, Gelman, and Xu (1999)’s work, in Chapter 8, we observed a strong correlation in the rank order of acquisition for the earliest words. Those words that were typically learned very early in one language tended to be very early learned in others. Second, we saw that some word categories – both syntactic and semantic – were typically overrepresetend across languages. Nouns generally were over-represented (with some cross-linguistic variability in the amount of over-representation). But beyond that, words for body parts, games and social routines, and sounds were all over-represented. And third, when we looked for systematic predictors of the ease of learning words across language, the predictor “babiness” – which captures association with infants – was among the strongest predictors, especially for early-learned words. Where does this similarity come from? Our findings likely emerge from a combination of children’s particular attention and interests; the communicative priorities of child-caregiver dyads; and the informational structure of language, which renders certain aspects of langauge easier to learn than others. We consider each of these in turn. The entities that are most common in children’s early vocabulary are also those w Interest- conceptual - priorities - not just frequency - drive content of vocab - semantic bias - no function words - same order of acquisition Dyadic interest and focus - very consistent across cultures “Not doing nuclear physics with a two-year-old” Snedeker adoption stuff - is it the learning problem or the cognitive (is it about the structure of language) color/time/adjectives? 16.2.3 Children take different routes into language Despite these aggregate similarities across children and across cultures, children individually take different routes into language. The speed with which they acquire language is highly variable in the first years of life and this variability itself is a constant across cultures. Further, children vary stably in the nature of their acquisition path, soem naming more objects and others combing words relatively more. Different routes into language Variably is a constant variability is endogenous referential/expressive distinction check longitudinal stability 16.3 Learning processes In Chapter 1, we introduced the idea of “process universals.” These cannot be universals of content as all of the content being reported by parents filling CDI forms is language-specific. Intead, the idea of process universals is that there are processes that operate in different language context to produce the observed pattern of phenomena. These processes could be – but need not be – learner-internal. They could also operate at the level of the child-caregiver dyad, for example. In what follows, we move away from the term “universal.” Although in principle our theoretical goal is process universals, in practice thelimitations of the analysis above are such that we can only speak about “consistent processes.” Not only do we have a maximum of 43 distinct language/instrument samples represented in any estimate, we have a maximum of 29 languages or dialects in any analysis (and often considerably fewer) . This sample, while strong in terms of the within-language estimates, is only a weak start in terms of cross-language estimates (see Piantadosi and Gibson 2014 for guidance on claims about strict universals). Further, there is a strong Indo-European and WEIRD (western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic) bias amongst the languages in the database (Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan 2010). Thus, some consistencies that we observe are probably conditioned on environmental consistencies as well as dyadic and child-internal processes. In the remainder of this chapter, we speculate on some of these. So what sort of developmental process of vocabulary learning could lead to these universals? Any claim of this sort must be very speculative. If pushed, we would point to the following (weak) proposals regarding processes that are consistent with some of our putative universals. Demographic differences are – at least – consistent with interactional-input theories of vocabulary development (Hart and Risley 1995; Hoff 2003; Weisleder and Fernald 2013) in which the more and higher-quality the input the child receives, the faster vocabulary grows. Under this hypothesis, first-born, female, and higher-maternal education children all are likely to receive more and higher-quality input: female children through the route of their somewhat greater social/interactional abilities (an extra assumption), first-born children through their greater allocation of parent attention, and high maternal-education children through greater parental awareness of the role of input, differering parental practices, and greater amount of leisure time to spend with children among other factors. Both the noun bias and the age-of-acquisition prediction results are consistent with the broader cross-situational viewpoint on acquisition (Smith and Yu 2008; Gleitman 1990). On this view, nouns are easy to learn because the more they are heard, the more opportunities children get to build consistent mappings between the words and their referents. In contrast, verbs and other predicates rely more on a base of nouns and a basic comprehension of the syntactic structures in which they appear in order to infer meaning in context. Thus they should be acquired relatively later and with relativel more support from shorter, easier-to-parse utterances (MLU as a predictor, for example). Cross-linguistic exceptions will tend to be for languages like Mandarin where many early-learned verbs are semantically-transparent enough to be learned cross-situationally. Correlations between grammar and the lexicon, as well as the greater role of MLU in predicting acquisition of function words are both consistent with views that posit gradual syntactic abstraction and generalization. Versions of such viewpoints exist throughout the broad theoretical space of language acquisition (Yang 2016; Tomasello 2003; Meylan et al. 2017), but all proposals rely on a learning mechanism in which generalizations about structure are graded and rely on the amount of evidence available. 16.4 Methodological themes Wordbank embodies our belief that scale is in itself transformative. The existence of a noun bias is a fascinating observation, but this observation gives limited leverage to differentiate theories. The magnitude of a noun bias provides more leverage for quantiative theorizing. And the distribution of magnitudes across many of the world’s languages gives greater leverage still. Our hope is that, by generalizing and applying many influential analyses by many contributors, our work here can affect theory more broadly.
