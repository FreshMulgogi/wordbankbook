Despite the importance of this question, establishing the mechanisms of early language acquisition has been difficult. Early language learning involves the accumulation of thousands of words, grammatical rules, and constructions, and takes place over the course of years of growth and millions of separate interactions. Further complicating the study of this process is the fact that, during the period in which language emerges, language ability varies wildly from child to child and most children are at best reluctant experimental participants. These two observations mean that accurate measurement of language development across individuals is a major challenge. Parent report is one powerful method for investigating. The MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CDI) is a simple survey instrument for measuring early language outcomes that was designed to address these issues.1 The CDI is a checklist for parents to fill out to report on their child’s progress in language. In different versions of the form, parents mark whether their child “says” or “says and understands” particular words out of a list of several hundred. Separate sections for gestures, word forms, and grammar are also present in some versions. Despite their simplicity, over the past 25 years of use, CDI forms have been shown to be reliable and valid measures of children’s early language. In addition, CDI forms have been adapted to more than 60 different languages around the world. Research based on the CDI has contributed tremendously to our understanding of the growth of language in early childhood. In this book, we examine the question of variability and consistency in early language through the lens of the CDI. This book is a product of the Wordbank project (M. C. Frank et al. 2016), a project deovted to archiving CDI data in a structured format so that it can be explored and analyzed in the service of describing vocabulary acquisition. The database currently contains data from more than 70198 CDI form administrations across length(unique(instruments$language)) languages. Wordbank is also continuously growing as new researchers contribute data. We believe this database is the largest and most diverse set of data on early language acquisition currently in existence. Over the course of our work with Wordbank, we have developed a consistent framework for representing and analyzing CDI data. This framework is statistically well-grounded and allows us to unify a variety of influential previous analyses of CDI data. Just to take an example, one question of theoretical interest has been whether young children have an over-representation of nouns (names for things) in their vocabulary, and whether this trend is seen across languages. In Chapter 4 , we develop an analytic method for measuring the size of this “noun bias” across languages and applied the analysis across all of the languages in Wordbank at the time. The result supports two generalizations that –- we believe -– clarify the situation in this previously-controversial field: 1) nouns are over-represented in most languages, but 2) East Asian languages do (as claimed) show far less noun bias. Our hope is that these findings will provide a baseline for future work. More generally, our intent is to contribute to the literature by synthesizing previous work. Research in early language learning often builds off a fragmentary empirical picture, in which many important theoretical conclusions are based on analyses of transcripts from a small number of children, or analyses of data from English learners. We hope that bringing together a large set of analyses of vocabulary data and implementing them consistently, openly, and reproducibly on the same dataset will help to create an empirical starting-point for future work. On the theoretical side, we develop the notion of “process universals” -– that aspects of the process of word learning may be universal across cultures and may lead to similarities in the dynamics of learning. These universals may arise due to the basic mechanisms of learning, memory, and social cognition that are at play in early vocabulary learning. This notion of process universals has a long history in the field (by Bates, Slobin and others), but the Wordbank project provides an opportunity to lend new empirical data and analytic power to these ideas. This notion is contrasted with notions of “content” or “structural” universals in which particular principles regarding the structure of languages are innately given. For purposes of clarity and ease throughout we refer to CDIs (the family of instruments) rather than the MB-CDI (the particular English forms).↩ "],
["intro.html", "1 Introduction 1.1 Practical Foundations: The MB-CDI and the Wordbank Project 1.2 Theoretical Foundations: Theories of Language Acquisition 1.3 Outline of the Book", " 1 Introduction (Some material in this chapter comes from M. C. Frank et al. (2016).) The emergence of children’s early language is one of the most miraculous parts of human development. The ability to communicate using language arrives with incredible rapidity – most parents judge that their child is producing words with the intent to communicate before his or her first word before their first birthday (???) and now several reports indicate that the onset of comprehension is even earlier (e.g., ???,(???)). Yet the path towards linguistic mastery is slow Almost uniquely in cognitive development, early language learning also offers an opportunity to study both consistency and variability in a single phenomenon. Often researchers interested in consistency have measured theoretically-important, carefully chosen phenomena using small convenience samples that suffice to show a proof-of-concept but do not provide information about variability. In contrast, work on variability between individuals has often focused on larger samples with more reliable tasks, that – perhaps as a consequence of their reliability – are less tightly linked to a particular theoretical construct of interest. The nature and course of early word learning is an important window into children’s growing understanding of the world. Early words cross-cut a variety of linguistic categories, but generally consist of names for caregivers (e.g., mama), common objects (e.g., bottle, shoe), social expressions (e.g., bye-bye), and actions or routines (e.g., peekaboo, throw) (Nelson 1973; Tardif et al. 2008). New words enter children’s expressive vocabularies slowly at first, but this process accelerates over the second year such that children reach an average of 300 words by 24 months and more than 60,000 by the time they graduate from high school (Larry Fenson et al. 2007). At the same time, there are significant individual differences in language acquisition. For example, according to detailed observational studies, although some 18-month-olds already produce 50–75 words, others produce no words at all, and will not do so until they are 22 months or older (e.g., Brown 1973; Bloom 2002; Clark 2003). How can such differences be measured accurately and efficiently? And can we promote early detection of differences in vocabulary growth that will be clinically significant later in development? 1.1 Practical Foundations: The MB-CDI and the Wordbank Project 1.1.1 Measuring early vocabulary Traditional studies of language development typically apply a combination of observational assessment and structured tests, frequently relying on short samples of interactions and small samples of children. Discerning both the universal features and natural variation of early lexical development has been greatly facilitated by the development of parent report instruments like the MacArthur-Bates CDI (L. Fenson et al. 1994; Larry Fenson et al. 2007) and the Language Development Survey (LDS; Rescorla 1989). The CDIs in particular were developed across a period of more than 40 years. Originally designed for use in a research study (E. Bates 1976), the instruments have evolved from a structured interview to the current paper-and-pencil format and are now increasingly administered online (e.g., Kristoffersen et al. 2013) for Norwegian or for Slovak). While other assessment tools exist for slightly older children, to our knowledge, no other measure allows cost-effective global language assessment for children in the critical age ranges between the emergence of language and the period when children become more able to engage in structured, face-to-face activities (around 30 months). Naturalistic observations are the other leading candidate for measurement of early language, but such observations are extremely costly and time-consuming to transcribe and annotate. These difficulties lead to a tradeoff where most studies either include dense data about a small number of children or smaller amounts of data with a larger sample size. Dense datasets currently provide the best method for in-depth study of the interaction between learning mechanisms and language input in individuals (e.g., E. Lieven, Salomo, and Tomasello 2009; B. C. Roy et al. 2015), although the generality of these studies is necessarily limited by their small sample sizes. At the other end of the spectrum, assessment of many individual language samples can yield information about individual variability [e.g., dickinson2001,cartmill2013,weisleder2013], but at some cost in terms of depth. In addition, naturalistic observations do not measure children’s language comprehension, a variable of interest for many early language researchers. Estimates of production vocabulary from naturalistic observation are highly correlated with the CDI within studies [e.g., bornstein1998], but are likely to be affected substantially by length of the session, context, and interlocutor when comparing across studies (see e.g., Hidaka 2015 for discussion). And although there exist methods to extract insights about global vocabulary from naturalistic observation, these statistical extrapolations are relatively new and have not been validated extensively (Hidaka 2015). Other comprehension vocabulary measures are also available across some range of languages (e.g., the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test 4; L. M. Dunn and Dunn 2007), but these assessments are tailored for substantially older children. Parent-report measures like the CDI and LDS take advantage of the fact that parents are expert observers of their child. CDI instruments ask about use of communicative gestures, grammar, and symbolic play, as well as vocabulary, which is measured using checklists consisting of representative samples of words. Parents choose the words their child currently understands'' (comprehension, measured for younger children) orsays’’ (production, measured for both younger and older children). The checklists contain words from many different semantic (e.g., animal names, household items) and syntactic (e.g., action words, connectives) categories, resulting in broader samples of lexical knowledge than are available from other methods. In their English and Spanish instantiations, the instruments come in two versions: Words &amp; Gestures (8–18 months) and Words &amp; Sentences (16–30 months). 1.1.2 Adaptation, not translation! Originally designed for English, parallel instruments have now been adapted for more than 60 languages (P. S. Dale and Penfold 2011). The ethic behind these instruments has been summarized as “adaptation, not translation” – in other words, to create forms with the same spirit as the English form, rather than to translate the items of the English form (which may be uninformative or inappropriate for another language community). EXAMPLES 1.1.3 Limitations of parent report Although the standardization of parent reports using the CDI contributes to the availability of large amounts of data in a comparable format, there are significant limitations to the parent report methodology as well . First, parents may be biased observers; some may overestimate, while others likely underestimate their children’s abilities. There is also some evidence that some variability may be due to reporting biases linked to factors such as SES . Second, parent reports of comprehension for younger children likely suffer from a number of biases and are probably substantially more accurate for content words than function words. Third, the items on the original CDI instruments were chosen to be a representative sample of vocabulary for the appropriate age and language , not with the intention that they would be a complete set of words that could be compared across instruments or that they would be individually reliable and license the conclusion that a particular child knows a particular word. Fourth, although the length of the CDI may give the impression that it yields an estimate of the child’s full vocabulary, in fact it likely understates the size of a child’s vocabulary substantially, especially for older children . Despite these limitations, when used appropriately the CDI instruments are still an important tool. The instruments were designed to minimize bias by targeting current behaviors and asking parents about highly salient features of their child’s abilities. They yield reliable and valid estimates of total vocabulary size, with dozens of studies demonstrating concurrent and predictive relations with naturalistic and observational measures, in both typically-developing and at-risk populations (e.g., P. S. Dale and Fenson 1996; D. Thal, Jackson-Maldonado, and Acosta 2000; Marchman and Martínez-Sussmann 2002). In addition, a variety of recent work has shown that individual item-level responses can yield exciting new insights, for example about the growth patterns of semantic networks (Hills et al. 2009; Hills et al. 2010). Such analyses have the potential to be even more powerful when applied to larger samples and across languages. Need to add sections/material on: + Limitations on cross-population comparison + Limitations on cross-linguistic comparison 1.1.4 Wordbank To take advantage of the opportunity posed by the broad use of CDI instruments in the child language community, in 2014 we began constructing Wordbank, an open repository for CDI data that allows for interactive analysis and visualization. Our inspiration for Wordbank came from two successful projects for sharing data on children’s language acquisition. The first is the Child Language Data Exchange System (CHILDES; MacWhinney 2000). A database of transcripts of children’s speech and speech to children, CHILDES has grown into a robust and important tool for the community, with many contributors and affiliated projects. The second is the Cross-Linguistic Lexical Norms site (CLEX; ; R. N. Jørgensen et al. 2010}), which is closer in content to Wordbank, and effectively our precursor. CLEX archives normative data from a range of CDI adaptations across languages, allowing browsing of acquisition trajectories for individual items or age groups. Wordbank builds on CLEX, offering the same functionality but allowing flexible and interactive visualization and analysis, as well as direct database access and data download. In addition, Wordbank’s goal was always toextend beyond normative data by dynamically incorporating data from many different researchers and projects of varying sizes and scopes. While the resulting datasets in Wordbank are much more heterogeneous than norming data, they are also larger and more representative than the individual norming datasets (in some cases), and available in languages where no norms exist (for others). 1.2 Theoretical Foundations: Theories of Language Acquisition There are many approaches to studying language learning. We distinguish a couple of major touchstones theories so that we can refer back to them. Theories of vocabulary acquisition: Constraints and Biases (Markman 1990) Cross-situational Learning (Yu and Ballard 2007) Theories of grammatical acquisition: Constructivist Principles and Parameters 1.2.1 The Process Universals Viewpoint Variation: Children vary tremendously. What predicts that variation? Consistency: Are there theoretical 1.3 Outline of the Book Although our goal is a full exploration of the phenomena of child language acquisition, the analyses we report are constrained by the structure of the data in Wordbank. At its heart, the individual instrument datasets stored in Wordbank are matrices of item x child data. Considering the data in this way (shown in Figure @ref(fig:1_outline_diagram)), leads to a number of obvious data analytic strategies, many of which correspond directly to previous approaches to CDI data. (#fig:1_outline_diagram)A graphical outline of the book. For example, averaging across items leads to by-child averages, where each child receives a comprehension or production score. Chapter 3 considers this view of the data, examining predictors of individual children’s vocabulary. Of course, chief among these is age, and developmental growth patterns as well as variability in development is considered in the first part of this chapter. But beyond age, even the limited demographic data available in Wordbank can be used to explore the data; we report the ways that vocabulary growth varies across gender, birth order, and maternal education (a rough but cross-cultually valid proxy for socio-economic status). These demographic predictors reveal both consistent and variable patterns across languages: while gender and birth-order effects are relatively constant, socio-economic effects vary widely in magnitude. Averaging across the other margin of the data leads to by-item averages. These can be examined in a number of different ways. First, items can be grouped into categories (both syntactic and semantic). Chapter 4 considers the categorical composition of early vocabulary, giving special consideration to the “noun bias” that is found in many – but not all – of the languages in Wordbank. Chapter 5 considers the growth trajectories for individual words and adopts the approach of predicting the trajectories of individual words based on both environmental and conceptual features of these words. This approach calls for the incorporation of other resources, and so we use a variety of English and cross-linguistic resources to supplement Wordbank data in this chapter. Not all items denote individual words, however, so in Chapters 6 and 7 we consider the gesture/communication and grammatical items that are included in some CDI forms. Chapter 6 follows up on the early work of (???) who explored the relationship between gesture and early vocabulary. Chapter 7 explores the work of (???), who considered the relationship between vocabulary growth and the growth of grammar and first reported the striking relationship between these variables. Both of these chapters (as well as the rest of the book) are deeply indebted to the Batesian vision of exploring the process of language learning. Many of the analyses reported here were first described in earlier publications (e.g., M. C. Frank et al. 2016,M. Braginsky et al. (2015),(???)). Rather than reprinting these, this manuscript updates them using the unified analytic approach and larger dataset described in Chapter 2. "],

Statistical Methods. Description of our approach to visualization and analysis, including specifications of the statistical models we use for quantifying effect sizes and comparing across studies.. Approach to cross-linguistic analysis. Since comparisons across languages are a key part of our contribution, we outline two different approaches that we use. We identify the difficulties in comparing across CDI forms (including across different languages and even across different forms in a single language). We provide some empirical analysis of how form length affects reporting. Every form an island. In this approach (EFAI), we compare scale-free measures of effect size across forms, not attempting to bridge the gaps between forms that have different items and different lengths (as well as being designed for different languages). Universal lemmas. We describe how, for a subset of languages, we identified and checked conceptual mappings that could be used to compare particular concepts across languages, which we call “universal lemmas” (ULs). Stuff about the CDI, data collection, population statistics… We use a number of shorthand terms throughout to make precise references to aspects of the CDI data. These are defined here. Instrument: A specific parent-report survey or questionnaire. Item: A particular question on an instrument. Includes words (with either produces or produces/understands responses), as well as other questions like questions about morphological or syntactic complexity. Administration: A particular instance of an instrument being given to a child. Child: A unique individual. Language: A particular language or language community for which an instrument has been adapted. Note that this definition of language distinguishes e.g. American and British English. 2.1 Database Architecture Example data from the CDI norming sample (Fenson et al., 2007). Each row has a unique child identifier, demographics, and word-by-word checklist data. Why use a database to store vocabulary data? Consider the standard format of raw CDI data. Here is a small slice of the original CDI norming data (L. Fenson et al. 1994; Larry Fenson et al. 2007). Each row is a child, each column gives a variable—either a demographic variable or the result of a particular word being administered to a particular child. Although this format is useful for homogeneous administrations of a single instrument, it cannot accommodate multiple instruments, multiple languages, or datasets with different sources or kinds of demographic information. Consolidating data across different instruments is very difficult in this format, and tracking data on children with multiple longitudinal administrations of a single instrument must also be done in an ad-hoc manner. The move to a database format allows far more flexible and programmatic handling of heterogeneous data structures from different sources. A relational database such as Wordbank is at its heart a series of tables linked by unique identifiers. There are two primary groups of tables in Wordbank. The common tables store data that is shared between CDI instruments, including information about administrations (individual instances of a form being filled out for a child), and items (words and other questions on a form). Then the instrument tables store response data for particular CDI instruments. We currently include all items on CDI instruments, including questions about communication, gesture, morphology, and grammar (though in many of the datasets that we archive these non-vocabulary questions have not been digitized so data on these are sparse at present; see Chapters ?? and ??). One strength of the Wordbank framework is that it allows the storage of subsidiary information about the words that are included in a particular instrument, so that this information can be used in future analyses. For example, information about grammatical and semantic categories or norms like concreteness and imageability could all be appended to particular words. This functionality is not yet present in Wordbank, however. The difficulty of compiling this kind of information for a particular set of words is compounded by the large number of languages that the database includes. We hope that in future this functionality will allow the gradual accumulation of information about the words included in the database. Wordbank is constructed using free, open-source tools. The database is a standard database, managed using and . Analysis apps are constructed using the package for , an open-source statistical programming language. The code is hosted in a GitHub repository () where interested users can browse, leave comments, and contribute modifications. All data uploaded to Wordbank are open and freely available for download, both through the site itself and through the GitHub repository. The site includes only de-identified data that cannot be linked to the parents and children who provided it. Because of these features, the Stanford Institutional Review Board has determined that the Wordbank project does not constitute human subjects research. The general philosophy of the CDI has been summarized as adaptation, not translation'' \\cite{dale2015}. In other words, CDIs are a useful tool for many languages, but the forms differ between languages---words and even whole sections are added, dropped, and modified to ensure that the form captures the details of the particular language for which it is designed. To date, more than 60 adaptations of the original English CDI have been documented \\cite{dale2011}. These forms vary widely, including differences in length and intended age range. Some forms include hundreds of items more than the original 680 words on the English Words \\&amp; Sentences form; others are so-calledshort forms’’ and include only a hundred or a few hundred carefully selected words. Some are designed to capture development from the emergence of language through ages 3–4 years, while others are focused on very early development (like the English Words &amp; Gestures form, designed for ages 8–18 months). All of these differences make it problematic to compare scores and score distributions across forms, even using percentile ranks, since some instruments will have more or more difficult items than others. Wordbank is designed so that it can accommodate data from a wide variety of instruments, both within and across languages. Indeed, at the time of writing, the site includes data from more than 42,000 administrations of the CDI across 14 different languages and 24 different instruments. But because of the difficulties in comparison across instruments, our approach to cross-linguistic and cross-instrument data is to provide standardized analyses within each instrument and language, without assuming equivalence across words, instruments, or populations. Thus, our exploratory visualization tools in general do not allow comparison across languages and we urge users to interpret cross-linguistic and cross-instrument differences with caution. Developing statistical techniques to facilitate these comparisons is a current focus of our research. 2.2 Data This section gives a broad overview of the data we have available. 2.2.1 Data Provenance Many languages are inherited from CLEX. Contributors are cited on the Wordbank contributors page. Importing is a process of standardizing idiosyncratic datasets into a common format. 2.2.2 Overview of the Data Wordbank curently has data from 23 language communities. Many of these are in the original Words &amp; Gestures (infant/toddler) / Words &amp; Sentences (child) format, with around 400 items in WG and 700 in the WS. Wordbank also includes some other forms that do not fit into this schema, including short forms and vocabulary questionnaires. Some of these are “short forms” with no internal category structure and fewer items overall. The number of administrations is variable across instruments and languages, however. 2.3 Wordbank Architecture 2.4 Statistical Methods We use medians instead of means. We use robust GLMs "],

This chapter focuses on a particular view of the data, namely that each child is represented by a single vocabulary score: the proportion of words that child knows out of the total in the form. Normative growth curves. We quantify the nature of variability across languages and note differences in form ceilings across languages. Demographic effects. The bulk of this chapter is devoted to different demographic predictors of vocabulary growth across languages (following the EFAI approach). We compare the effects of gender (female advantage), birth order (first-born advantage), and maternal education (socioeconomic status – SES – advantage). This set of analyses examines general patterns of vocabulary development. 3.1 Norms Here we examine general patterns of variability across languages. 3.1.1 Comprehension 3.1.2 Production Words and Gestures. Words and Sentences 3.1.3 Comparions of Variability on Comprehension and Production 3.2 Demographic Variables We examine the patterns of vocabulary growth for individual demographic variables. To make these analyses work, we assume that all demographics interact with age in a simple way in the models, such that there is only one coefficient associated with the effect: age * demographic - demographic All of these analyses are carried out on production data. 3.2.1 Gender This analysis examines how vocabulary development differs by children’s reported gender, replicating and extending the results of: Eriksson, M., Marschik, P. B., Tulviste, T., Almgren, M., Pérez Pereira, M., Wehberg, S., … Gallego, C. (2012). Differences between girls and boys in emerging language skills: Evidence from 10 language communities.

One simple way to do so is to integrate the area between curves. The units for this analysis are arbitrary and (right now) can’t be compared across languages, since the curves have different lengths. To overcome this limitation, we’d need to look at First look at gender advantage. Visualizing demographic advantages against one another. "],

This chapter focuses on splitting vocabulary data into syntactic and semantic categories and analyzing consistency and variability across languages in the acquisition of these. Syntactic category biases. We quantify the “noun bias” across languages. In addition, we report the degree of bias for or against verbs and closed-class words. Previously presented in Braginsky et al. (2015b). Conceptual categories. We investigate the consistency of colors, spatial terms, logical terms, and other conceptual categories of interest. Some of these semantic categories have been argued to be learned as a group, so we investigate whether they are more consistently correlated within children than would be expected by chance. An earlier version of this work was reported to BUCLD 2015 by Braginsky, Marchman, Yurovsky, &amp; Frank. Early vocabulary development is typically characterized by learning of names for caregivers and common objects, while later in development, children tend to diversify their vocabulary by increasing the proportion of predicates (verbs and adjectives) and closed class words. This over-representation of nouns has been found across a number of analyses and in a variety of languages (E. Bates et al. 1994; Caselli et al. 1995; ???), though not all (Tardif 1996; Choi and Gopnik 1995). Differences in early vocabulary composition have been argued to emerge from typological differences (e.g., word order, subject drop), and from cultural practices (e.g., focus on picture book reading) (Tardif, Gelman, and Xu 1999; Gopnik, Choi, and Baumberger 1996; Choi and Gopnik 1995)—we are agnostic as to the source of this variability. Figure from Bates et al. (1994), showing developmental trends in the categorical composition of early vocabulary. 4.1 Methods Each CDI form contains a mixture of words in different classes. We adopt the categorization of E. Bates et al. (1994), splitting words into nouns, predicates (verbs and adjectives), function words, and other words. For each child’s vocabulary, we compute the proportion of the total words in each of these categories that they are reported to produce. For each of the four languages in our sample, we plot these proportions against total vocabulary. Each dot represents a child’s knowledge of a particular class, while curves show the relationship between a class and the whole vocabulary. If categories grow independently of one another, these curves should approximate the diagonal. This pattern is not what we observe, however: Across the languages in our sample, nouns are systematically over-represented in smaller vocabularies (shown by a curve that is above the diagonal), while function words—and to some extent, predicates—are under-represented. We limit our analysis to traditional WS and WG forms for now because short forms like the British English TEDS don’t have category information. The sample sizes included in this analysis are given below. 4.1.1 Estimation Method How do we estimate over-representation or under-representation of a particular vocabulary item? Function for resampling data and computing area estimate for each sample. Resample data and find the mean and CI of the area estimate. 4.2 Syntactic Vocabulary Composition Base plot for looking at vocabulary composition. 4.2.1 Production: Words and Sentences Plot WS productive vocabulary composition as a function of vocabulary size for each language. 4.2.2 Production: Words and Gestures Plot WG productive vocabulary composition as a function of vocabulary size for each language. These data are much sparser and don’t really license strong inferences in many cases. (Most children produce a relatively small number of the words on WG forms). ### Comprehension: Words and Gestures Plot WG receptive vocabulary composition as a function of vocabulary size for each language. 4.2.3 Summary across and measures Plot each lexical category’s area estimate by language, form, and measure. Plot WS production vocab composition proportions. 4.3 Age effects on vocabulary composition We predict that the proportion of predicates and function words in children’s vocabulary should be relatively more affected by age than nouns. Concrete nouns are hypothesized to be learned initially from both co-occurrences between words (Yu and Smith 2007) and by social cues to reference to particular objects (Bloom 2002). On neither account should syntactic information be a primary information source (though of course syntax might be more informative for abstract nouns). In contrast, for other types of words, syntax should be more important for learning their meaning. On the syntactic bootstrapping hypothesis (Gleitman 1990; ???), verbs especially are learned by mapping the syntactic structure of utterances to the thematic structure of observed events, for example by noticing that the subject of a sentence matches the agent in one particular ongoing event but not another (``the cat is fleeing the dog’’ matches flees(cat, dog) but not chases(dog,cat)). A similar argument can be made for adjectives, since identification of the modified noun is similarly critical for inferring the meaning of the modifier. And by the same logic, function words should be even harder to learn without some understanding of their syntactic role. Thus, if syntactic development is related in some way to age, we should see larger age effects on predicate and function word vocabulary than on noun vocabulary. In all four languages, the age coefficient is substantially larger for function words than for nouns. This asymmetry can be interpreted as evidence that, for two vocabulary-matched children, the older child would tend to produce relatively more function words than the younger. 4.4 Semantic Category Representation The same analyses could be done with CDI categories, which are semantic rather than lexical.

On some accounts, children’s early syntax emerges from direct generalizations from particular lexical items, while on others, syntactic structure is acquired independently and follows its own timetable. Progress on differentiating these views requires detailed developmental data. Using parent reports of vocabulary and grammar abilities, previous analyses have shown that early syntactic abstraction strongly depends on the growth of the lexicon, providing support for lexicalist and emergentist theories. Using a large crosslinguistic database in four languages, we replicate and extend these findings, demonstrating similar patterns in each language. At the same time, the power of our dataset reveals measurable effects of age over and above those attributable to vocabulary size, and that these effects are greater for aspects of language ability more closely tied to syntax. These findings suggest non-lexical contributions to the growth of syntactic abstraction that all theories must address. 7.2 Introduction A child as young as two or three (who happens to be acquiring English) can hear someone say Alice glipped the blicket and draw a wealth of inferences from the morphological and syntactic structure of that utterance: that Alice and blicket are entities in the world and glipping is an action; that Alice is the one glipping and the blicket is the thing being glipped; that glipping occurred in the past (rather than the present, as in Alice is glipping the blicket); that a single blicket was involved (rather than multiple, as in Alice glipped the blickets). What mechanisms underlie the formation of generalizations that support such inferences? Does an understanding of the abstract structure of language emerge from the interactions of individual words, or is structure acquired and represented separately? On nativist theories like principles and parameters (Chomsky 1981; ???), grammar emerges independently from lexical knowledge following its own, largely maturational, timetable. According to lexicalist theories, in contrast, morphosyntactic structure emerges from graded generalizations on the basis of lexical items, and at least early in development, there may be little or no representation of morphosyntactic rules or regularities per se (Tomasello 2003). Even when syntactic structures are eventually represented, these representations are directly related to more concrete lexical structure (Bannard, Lieven, and Tomasello 2009). Therefore, grammatical development should be tightly yoked to lexical development (Bates and Goodman 1999). Data on the relationship between the lexicon, grammar, and age are important for informing this fundamental theoretical debate. One source of such data is the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CDI), a widely-used assessment tool in which parents report which words their child produces on a checklist organized by lexical-semantic categories. Children’s vocabulary size can thus be estimated over the entire checklist, or for sub-categories. The CDI also provides indices of grammar learning by asking about children’s use of inflected forms (e.g., walked) and the complexity of their word combinations (e.g., kitty sleeping / kitty is sleeping). Influential early findings using this measure showed that early vocabularies tend to be composed primarily of nouns, while verbs and closed-class forms, which might support the transition into complex sentences, are typically acquired later (E. Bates et al. 1994). Further, across different populations and languages, global estimates of grammatical development were more strongly predicted by overall vocabulary size than by age, providing support for lexicalist theories (see Bates and Goodman 1999 for a review). 7.3 Methods In all four languages, the CDI forms contain both vocabulary checklists and other questions relevant to the child’s linguistic development. All of the data reported here come from the Words &amp; Sentences form, administered to children ages 16–32 months. Each of these instruments includes a Vocabulary section, which asks whether the child produces each of around 700 words from a variety of semantic and syntactic categories (e.g., , , ); a Word Form section, which asks whether the child produces each of around 30 morphologically inflected forms of nouns and verbs (e.g., , ); and a Complexity section, which asks whether the child’s speech is most similar to the syntactically simpler or more complex versions of around 40 sentences (e.g., , ). Each language’s instrument is not just a translation of the English form, but rather was constructed and normed to reflect the lexicon and grammar of that language. To analyze lexical and grammatical development, we derive several measures. Each child’s Vocabulary Size is computed as the proportion of words on the corresponding CDI form that the child is reported to produce. Similarly, each child’s Word Form score is the proportion of word forms they are reported to produce, and their Complexity score the proportion of complexity items for which they are reported to use the more complex form. We compute all of these quantities as proportions to make the scales comparable across languages. Show number of items in each relevant section.

Note the hack of thinking of everything that’s not complexity as being word form.

Note that cubic clms don’t work that well here. 7.5 Grammar, development, and the lexicon We explore a hypothesis that was not explicitly tested in these earlier studies: that there remains age-related variance in grammatical development unexplained by vocabulary development. While the overall relationship between grammar and the lexicon provides support for lexicalist theories, the identification of age-related variance would suggest the presence of developmental processes that regulate grammar learning, above and beyond those captured by measures of vocabulary size. Such age-related processes could be either maturational or experiential, and either domain-general (like working memory) or language-specific (like grammatical competency). Importantly, since both nativist and constructivist theories could in principle predict age-linked variance in grammatical development, our goal in the current work is not to differentiate these theories, but instead to test this novel prediction and explore its implications for future work on understanding the processes of grammatical development. An additional contribution of work is that, due to the size of our dataset, we are able to make more fine-grained distinctions than the initial cut between grammar and the lexicon. In particular, we distinguish morphology from multi-word syntax, since morphological generalizations might be more specifically dependent on vocabulary size than those requiring more global, sentence-level syntactic regularities. Similarly, we distinguish age-related contributions to different parts of the vocabulary. Lexical items like verbs and even more so function words require some syntactic information to learn (Gleitman 1990) and hence might be more linked to age-related factors that extend beyond vocabulary size. By two years, most children have a sizable working vocabulary, including verbs, prepositions, and closed class forms that perform grammatical work. They are also beginning to use multi-word combinations (e.g., ) and may demonstrate productive use of inflectional morphemes (e.g., past tense ). Previous studies have found a strong connection between the size of the lexicon and grammatical development as measured by the Complexity section, in many languages including English, Italian, Hebrew, and Spanish {bates1999}. However, no studies have had the power and cross-linguistic representation to go beyond this initial finding to explore relations to grammatical items that vary in morphosyntactic features. We extend this work by examining grammatical development using two measures: the Word Form checklist as a window into morphology and the Complexity checklist as a window into syntax. For each measure, we investigate the effects of vocabulary size and age. This suggests that the mechanisms guiding vocabulary and grammar learning are highly interdependent (Tomasello 2003; Bresnan 2001), a view at odds with the nativist assumption that grammar emerges independent of the lexicon (Chomsky 1981). We wanted to estimate how much variance in children’s syntactic and morphological development remains after accounting for that child’s vocabulary size. Specifically, we asked whether age provides additional predictive power beyond vocabulary size. To estimate this effect, we fit logistic regression models to each child’s Word Form and Complexity scores, predicting score as a function of vocabulary size and age in months. For all languages and measures, the evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of the model using both vocabulary and age as predictors, as compared to the model using only vocabulary (the smallest difference in AIC is 76). %Main effects were always exceedingly reliable, but the interaction term had negligible magnitude and so we omit it here. Figure~ shows data and models: each dot represents a child’s score on a measure, while curves show the relationship between score and vocabulary size. %As seen most clearly for English and Norwegian—the languages for which we have most data— For all languages, the curves for Word Form are near-overlapping, showing little differentiation across age groups. This indicates only small contributions of age above and beyond vocabulary. In contrast, the curves for Complexity show a characteristic fan across age groups, indicating that the relationship between vocabulary size and complexity score is modulated by age. %The Spanish and Danish data show less of a clear complexity curve fan, possibly because of the relatively small number of data points in the youngest age group. Choosing cut points here is hard, since the age distribution/density is different from language to language. UNUSED MODEL BASED ANALYSES BELOW Plot age effect coefficients for each language and measure. Fit models for each wordform and complexity item and get their age coefficients. Function for plotting age effect coefficients by item for a language. Plot item interactions for Norwegian. Plot item interactions for English. Plot item interactions for Danish. Plot item interactions for Spanish. Because of the size of our samples, all main effects and interactions are highly significant. To assess the extent of the age contribution to children’s morphological and syntactic development, we compared the coefficients of Word Form and Complexity models. Figure~ shows the coefficient of the age effect for each measure across languages. In each language, the age effect coefficient is substantially larger for Complexity than Word Form, indicating a greater age effect on those items that generally align with syntax than morphology. Given the heterogeneous nature of the CDI instruments, particularly in the Complexity sections, we further broke down these items by classifying them as capturing more morphological or more syntactic phenomena. Items for which the difference between the simple and complex sentences is in the inflection of a noun or verb (such as ) were coded as Morphological. The remainder of the items were coded as Syntactic, since they involve the use of some sentence-level syntactic construction (such as ). We then fit predictive models as above separately for every item. Figure shows the age effect coefficient of each item. In general, there is a three-way split: age effects are smallest for Word Form items, then Morphological Complexity items, and largest for Syntactic Complexity items, suggesting more syntactic phenomena have greater age contributions. Building on previous analyses that showed a strong relationship between lexical and grammatical development, we added age into this relationship. Across languages, our measures of syntactic development consistently showed greater age modulation than measures of morphological development. Further distinguishing between items that were more reflective of morphology than syntax, we again found greater age effects for more syntactic items. Thus, this analysis provides evidence for a relationship between syntactic development and age captured by lexical development. 7.6 Discussion The current study revisits classic findings but also explores novel questions regarding lexicon-grammar relations and vocabulary composition through Wordbank, a newly-developed web-based tool for cross-linguistic analyses of large CDI datasets. Our results provided general support for a lexicalist view, in that, in four languages, variance in vocabulary production strongly aligned with variance in grammar. However, we also estimated additional age-related contributions, specifically contrasting the links to morphological forms vs. syntactic constructions, and for different lexical categories. In general, we find that measures of grammar that are more closely aligned with syntax are modulated by age to a greater extent than those reflecting inflectional morphology. Also, we find that the trajectories of predicate and function word representation in the vocabulary are modulated by age to a greater extent than noun representation (albeit with some variability across languages). Both findings suggest a place for developmental processes that facilitate grammatical acquisition beyond pure lexical growth. Our analyses suggest interesting new areas of research regarding possible mechanisms driving children’s early lexical development and how those mechanisms might support children’s transition from single words to more morphosyntactically complex utterances. One possibility is that these developments are dependent on maturational factors that operate on grammatical development in a domain-specific way, independent of lexical-semantic processes. Another possibility is that age-related effects represent more domain-general learning mechanisms, such as attention or working memory, that provide differential support for sentence-level processes than word-internal ones . Future studies should also explore the extent to which lexical and age-related processes are shaped, either independently or in tandem, by features of the learning environments that children experience &lt;e.g.,&gt;{weisleder2013}. Questions about the nature of morphosyntactic representations in early language have often seemed deadlocked. But by mapping out developmental change across large samples and multiple languages, our findings here challenge theories across the full range of perspectives to more fully describe the mechanistic factors underlying the interaction of vocabulary, grammar, and development.
