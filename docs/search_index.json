We compare the effects of gender (female advantage), birth order (first-born advantage), and maternal education (socioeconomic status – SES – advantage). We develop a framework for comparing the magnitude of these effects. 4.0.1 Gender This analysis examines how vocabulary development differs by children’s reported gender, replicating and extending the results of: Eriksson, M., Marschik, P. B., Tulviste, T., Almgren, M., Pérez Pereira, M., Wehberg, S., … Gallego, C. (2012). Differences between girls and boys in emerging language skills: Evidence from 10 language communities. British Journal of Developmental Psychology 30, 326–343. An earlier version of this analysis was reported in Frank et al. (2016). Plot vocabulary size over age by gender. Get gender in terms of MMAD 4.0.2 Maternal education We use maternal education as a proxy for socio-economic status. 4.0.3 Birth order Only 8 languages have birth order data, and only 7 languages have it for WS. 4.0.4 Demographic effect sizes 4.1 MMAD method Demographics in terms of MMAD 4.2 ABC method How can we compare the size of these different demographic effects? One simple way to do so is to integrate the area between curves. The units for this analysis are arbitrary and (right now) can’t be compared across languages, since the curves have different lengths. To overcome this limitation, we’d need to look at First look at gender advantage. From this perspective it is quite clear that the Italian effect is anomalous. FIXME: what do we say about this? Visualizing demographic advantages against one another. "]
