We call this combination “stitching.” This appendix provides some motivation for the practice. Figure C.1 shows 25 randomly-sampled items from the American English data. To a first approximation, production trajectories line up quite nicely with little or no visible gap between the two instruments. Figure C.1: WS and WG proportion production scores for a set of 25 randomly-sampled examples. "]
