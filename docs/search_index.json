Despite the importance of this question, establishing the mechanisms of early language acquisition has been difficult. Early language learning involves the accumulation of thousands of words, grammatical rules, and constructions, and takes place over the course of years of growth and millions of separate interactions. Further complicating the study of this process is the fact that, during the period in which language emerges, language ability varies wildly from child to child and most children are at best reluctant experimental participants. These two observations mean that accurate measurement of language development across individuals is a major challenge. Parent report is one powerful method for investigating this development. The MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CDI) is a simple survey instrument for measuring early language outcomes that was designed to address these issues.1 The CDI is a checklist for parents to fill out to report on their child’s progress in language. In different versions of the form, parents mark whether their child “says” or “says and understands” particular words out of a list of several hundred. Separate sections for gestures, word forms, and grammar are also present in some versions. Despite their simplicity, over the past 25 years of use, CDI forms have been shown to be reliable and valid measures of children’s early language. In addition, CDI forms have been adapted to more than 60 different languages around the world. Research based on the CDI has contributed tremendously to our understanding of the growth of language in early childhood. In this book, we examine the question of variability and consistency in early language through the lens of the CDI. This book is a product of the Wordbank project (M. C. Frank et al. 2016), a project devoted to archiving CDI data in a structured format so that it can be explored and analyzed in the service of describing vocabulary acquisition. The database currently contains data from more than 71933 CDI form administrations across 25 languages. Wordbank is also continuously growing as new researchers contribute data. We believe this database is the largest and most diverse set of data on early language acquisition currently in existence. Over the course of our work with Wordbank, we have developed a consistent framework for representing and analyzing CDI data. This framework is statistically well-grounded and allows us to unify a variety of influential previous analyses of CDI data. Just to take an example, one question of theoretical interest has been whether young children have an over-representation of nouns (names for things) in their vocabulary, and whether this trend is seen across languages. In Chapter 5, we develop an analytic method for measuring the size of this “noun bias” across languages and applied the analysis across all of the languages in Wordbank at the time. The result supports two generalizations that – we believe – clarify the situation in this previously-controversial field: 1) nouns are over-represented in most languages, but 2) East Asian languages do (as claimed) show far less noun bias. Our hope is that these findings will provide a baseline for future work. More generally, our intent is to contribute to the literature by synthesizing previous work. Research in early language learning often builds off a fragmentary empirical picture, in which many important theoretical conclusions are based on analyses of transcripts from a small number of children, or analyses of data from English learners. We hope that bringing together a large set of analyses of vocabulary data and implementing them consistently, openly, and reproducibly on the same dataset will help to create an empirical starting-point for future work. On the theoretical side, we develop the notion of “process universals” – that aspects of the process of word learning may be universal across cultures and may lead to similarities in the dynamics of learning. These universals may arise due to the basic mechanisms of learning, memory, and social cognition that are at play in early vocabulary learning. This notion of process universals has a long history in the field (by Bates, Slobin and others), but the Wordbank project provides an opportunity to lend new empirical data and analytic power to these ideas. This notion is contrasted with notions of “content” or “structural” universals in which particular principles regarding the structure of languages are innately given. Outline of the Book Although our goal is a full exploration of the phenomena of child language acquisition, the analyses we report are constrained by the structure of the data in Wordbank. At its heart, the individual instrument datasets stored in Wordbank are matrices of item x child data. Considering the data in this way (shown in Figure @ref(1_outline_diagram)), leads to a number of obvious data analytic strategies, many of which correspond directly to previous approaches to CDI data. (#fig:1_outline_diagram)A graphical outline of the book. For example, averaging across items leads to by-child averages, where each child receives a comprehension or production score. Chapter 3 considers this view of the data, examining predictors of individual children’s vocabulary. Of course, chief among these is age, and developmental growth patterns as well as variability in development is considered in the first part of this chapter. But beyond age, even the limited demographic data available in Wordbank can be used to explore the data; we report the ways that vocabulary growth varies across gender, birth order, and maternal education (a rough but cross-cultually valid proxy for socio-economic status). These demographic predictors reveal both consistent and variable patterns across languages: while gender and birth-order effects are relatively constant, socio-economic effects vary widely in magnitude. Averaging across the other margin of the data leads to by-item averages. These can be examined in a number of different ways. First, items can be grouped into categories (both syntactic and semantic). Chapter 5 considers the categorical composition of early vocabulary, giving special consideration to the “noun bias” that is found in many – but not all – of the languages in Wordbank. Chapter 7 considers the growth trajectories for individual words and adopts the approach of predicting the trajectories of individual words based on both environmental and conceptual features of these words. This approach calls for the incorporation of other resources, and so we use a variety of English and cross-linguistic resources to supplement Wordbank data in this chapter. Not all items denote individual words, however, so in Chapters 10 and 11, we consider the gesture/communication and grammatical items that are included in some CDI forms. Chapter 10 follows up on the early work of L. Fenson et al. (1994) who explored the relationship between gesture and early vocabulary. Chapter 11 explores the work of Bates and Goodman (1999) and Marchman and Bates (1994), who considered the relationship between vocabulary growth and the growth of grammar and first reported the striking relationship between these variables. Both of these chapters (as well as the rest of the book) are deeply indebted to the Batesian vision of exploring the process of language learning. How to Read This Book You can read as a narrative monograph. If you do so, we recommend you look at Practical Foundations and Methods before moving on to substantive chapters of interest. We also recommend you read our theoretical synthesis in the Conclusions chapter. You can read as a reference book. If you take this approach, just dive into any chapter that is of interest, knowing that you may need to use some of the terminology defined in the Methods chapter to interpret the constructs and analysess that are used. Many of the analyses reported here were first described in earlier publications (e.g., M. C. Frank et al. 2016,M. Braginsky et al. (2015),Braginsky et al. (n.d.)). Rather than reprinting these, this manuscript updates them using the unified analytic approach and larger dataset described in Chapter 2. The version of these analyses represented in the manuscript should be considered more definitive than any previously published or presented version. Static Book, Dynamic Data The dataset in Wordbank is constantly growing and changing as we add new features, new data, and new languages. In addition, as users of the data occasionally identify issues and errors, we make will make corrections to the database. In writing this manuscript, we have attempted to find a middle ground between a completely dynamic document that responds to any change in the database on the one hand and a traditional, static book on the other. A static manuscript would be a shame given the potential for dynamic extension and updating with new data. On the other hand, if the data were completely dynamic, any claim we made in prose would risk being out of date almost as soon as we wrote it. For this reason, we work using snapshots of the underlying database. Every so often, we will return to the manuscript and recompile the online edition, then check references to the data that might have changed. This build of the book is based on FIXME DATE. For purposes of clarity and ease throughout we refer to CDIs (the family of instruments) rather than the MB-CDI (the particular English forms).↩ "],
["intro.html", "1 Practical Foundations 1.1 Measuring early vocabulary 1.2 Logic of Parent Report 1.3 Limitations of parent report 1.4 Adaptations, not translations! 1.5 Wordbank", " 1 Practical Foundations (Some material in this chapter comes from M. C. Frank et al. (2016) and Marchman and Dale (2017)) The emergence of children’s early language is one of the most miraculous parts of human development. The ability to communicate using language arrives with incredible rapidity – most parents judge that their child is producing words with the intent to communicate before his or her first birthday (Schneider, Yurovsky, and Frank 2015) and now several reports indicate that the onset of comprehension is even earlier (e.g., Bergelson and Swingley 2012,Tincoff and Jusczyk (1999)). Yet the path towards linguistic mastery is slow. Almost uniquely in cognitive development, early language learning also offers an opportunity to study both consistency and variability in a single phenomenon. Often researchers interested in consistency have measured theoretically-important, carefully-chosen phenomena using small convenience samples that suffice to show a proof-of-concept but do not provide information about variability. In contrast, work on variability between individuals has often focused on larger samples with more reliable tasks, that – perhaps as a consequence of their reliability – are less tightly linked to a particular theoretical construct of interest. The nature and course of early word learning is an important window into children’s growing understanding of the world. Early words cross-cut a variety of linguistic categories, but generally consist of names for caregivers (e.g., mama), common objects (e.g., bottle, shoe), social expressions (e.g., bye-bye), and actions or routines (e.g., peekaboo, throw) (Nelson 1973; Tardif et al. 2008). New words enter children’s expressive vocabularies slowly at first, but this process accelerates over the second year such that children reach an average of 300 words by 24 months and more than 60,000 by the time they graduate from high school (Larry Fenson et al. 2007). At the same time, there are significant individual differences in the rate and timing of language acquisition. For example, according to detailed observational studies, although some 18-month-olds already produce 50–75 words, others produce no words at all, and will not do so until they are 22 months or older (e.g., Brown 1973; Bloom 2002; Clark 2003). Moreover, some children show increases in their rate of vocabulary growth well before the end of the 2nd year, others not until well after their 2nd birthday, and still others may not “spurt” at all (Larry Fenson et al. 2007; Goldfield and Reznick 1990; Ganger and Brent 2004). How can such differences be measured accurately and efficiently? And can we promote early detection of differences in vocabulary growth that will be clinically significant later in development? 1.1 Measuring early vocabulary Traditional studies of language development typically apply a combination of observational assessment and structured tests, frequently relying on short samples of interactions and small samples of children. Discerning both the universal features and natural variation of early lexical development has been greatly facilitated by the development of parent report instruments like the MacArthur-Bates CDI (L. Fenson et al. 1994; Larry Fenson et al. 2007) and the Language Development Survey (LDS; Rescorla 1989). The CDIs in particular were developed across a period of more than 40 years. Originally designed for use in a research study (Bates 1976), the instruments have evolved from a structured interview to the current paper-and-pencil format and are now increasingly administered online (e.g., Kristoffersen et al. 2013) for Norwegian or for Slovak). While other assessment tools exist for slightly older children, to our knowledge, no other measure allows cost-effective global language assessment for children in the critical age ranges between the emergence of language and the period when children become more able to engage in structured, face-to-face activities (around 30 months). Naturalistic observations are the other leading candidate for measurement of early language, but such observations are extremely costly and time-consuming to transcribe and annotate. These difficulties lead to a tradeoff where most studies either include dense data about a small number of children or smaller amounts of data with a larger sample size. Dense datasets currently provide the best method for in-depth study of the interaction between learning mechanisms and language input in individuals (e.g., E. Lieven, Salomo, and Tomasello 2009; B. C. Roy et al. 2015), although the generalizability of these studies is necessarily limited by their small sample sizes. At the other end of the spectrum, assessment of many individual language samples can yield information about individual variability (e.g., Dickinson and Tabors 2001; Cartmill et al. 2013; Weisleder and Fernald 2013), but at some cost in terms of depth. In addition, naturalistic observations do not measure children’s language comprehension, a variable of interest for many early language researchers. Estimates of production vocabulary from naturalistic observation are highly correlated with the CDI within studies (e.g., Bornstein and Haynes 1998), but are likely to be affected substantially by length of the session, context, and interlocutor when comparing across studies (see e.g., Hidaka 2015 for discussion). And although there exist methods to extract insights about global vocabulary from naturalistic observation, these statistical extrapolations are relatively new and have not been validated extensively (Hidaka 2015). Other comprehension vocabulary measures are also available across some range of languages (e.g., the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test 4; L. M. Dunn and Dunn 2007), but these assessments are tailored for children older than 2 1/2 years. 1.2 Logic of Parent Report Parent-report instruments like the CDI and LDS take advantage of the fact that parents (or other primary caregivers) are expert observers of their child. Parent reports are based on experiences with the child which are not only more extensive than any researcher or clinician can obtain, but are more representative of the child’s ability. Parents have experience with children at play, at meals, at bath and bedtime, at tantrums – in short, with the full range of the child’s life and therefore with the full range of language structures used in these contexts. Parents also have had opportunities to hear the child interact with other people: the other parent, grandparents, siblings, and friends. Because responses on these instruments represent an aggregation over much time and many situations, they are less influenced by factors that can mask a child’s true ability in the laboratory or clinic, such as shyness or compliance, or that can impact the validity of naturalistic sampling, such as word frequency. As Bates, Bretherton, and Snyder (1991) point out, “parental report is likely to reflect what a child knows, whereas [a sample of] free speech reflects those forms that she is more likely to use.” (p. 57). The application of parent report enables the collection of data from far larger samples of children than would be possible with standardized tests or naturalistic observation. Information from more adequate samples, especially in the form of norms, can benefit both clinical practice and research. L. Fenson et al. (1994), for example, used the norming data from the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (CDIs) - a sample of 2,550 children aged 8 to 30 months - to address questions about variability in communicative development. Large samples are especially needed to provide an accurate statistical description of extreme scores, i.e., what score corresponds to the 10th percentile? What does the most advanced child (e.g., &gt; 90th percentile) look like at a given age? Research on questions such as environmental influences on language development can also benefit from large samples. Correlational research is hampered by the problem of multicollinearity: The predictor variables such as parental education, number of books in the home, family size, use of questions vs. imperatives, are likely to be intercorrelated, making it difficult to separate the effects of each of them individually. Large samples in which there is a substantial amount of non-overlapping variance are essential for addressing these questions. An additional advantage of the parent-report method is that parents can also report on many different sub-components and correlates of early vocabulary development. In particular, the CDI instruments ask about use of communicative gestures, grammar, and symbolic play, as well as vocabulary comprehension and production. Information about what early vocabulary development correlates with, and what it does not, can yield important theoretical information about the common mechanisms underlying learning. As Bates, Bretherton, and Snyder (1991) note, studies which have the power and scope to examine what “hangs together” across early language development can provide critical clues to how the system is put together in the first place (p. 7). The main core of the CDIs is the vocabulary checklist. This list is essentially a ‘bag of words’ which represents the set of words that best capture variation in lexical development across the full spectrum of child ages and abilities. Parents choose the words their child currently “understands” (comprehension, measured for younger children) or “says” (production, measured for both younger and older children). The checklists contain words from many different semantic (e.g., animal names, household items) and syntactic (e.g., action words, connectives) categories, resulting in broader samples of lexical knowledge than are available from other methods. In their English and Spanish instantiations, the vocabulary checklists come in two versions: Words &amp; Gestures (W&amp;G) (8–18 months) which contains about 400 words, and the Words &amp; Sentences (W&amp;S) (16–30 months), which contains about 700 words. A child’s score on a vocabulary checklist represents their comprehension or production “vocabulary size,” indexing that child’s relative status against other children assessed with the same list. 1.3 Limitations of parent report Although the standardization of parent reports using the CDI contributes to the availability of large amounts of data in a comparable format, there are significant limitations to the parent report methodology as well (Tomasello and Mervis 1994, Feldman et al. (2000)). Clearly there are legitimate concerns about the ability of parents to provide detailed and specific knowledge about their children’s language. What does it mean when a parent reports that their child knows a word? In an ideal world, parental report would be an unbiased reflection of their observation of their child’s language development: When asked if their child produces the word dog, a parent would try to recall situations in which their child has used the word dog correctly, and report the success or failure of this process of recollection. There are, however, a number of other sources of information that the parent might bring to bear. Figure uses graphical model notation to depict information that could be reflected in parent report (Jordan 2004). The statistical structure of parent report The nodes in this model reflect variables of interest–shaded gray if they are observed, and hollow if they are latent variables that the parent does not have direct access. The edges in this graph represent statistical dependencies among these variables. For each word on the CDI, the parent is asked to report \\(O_{c}\\): have they observed their child producing the word? This observed variable depends on a latent variable \\(K_{c}\\): whether their child knows the meaning of this word. This knowledge in turn depends in three other variables: \\(O_{p}\\) the parent’s productions of this word in the past, \\(d\\) the difficulty of learning this word, and \\(\\mu_{c}\\) the child’s general linguistic ability. This general ability in turn depends on the parent’s linguistic ability \\(\\mu_{p}\\) and age-related factors \\(\\alpha_{c}\\). In addition, the CDI does not ask about every word in the child’s vocabulary, only items on the form \\(i\\). Because all of these other variables are statistically related to the child’s observed productions, parents could be be bringing any or all of them to bear in their responses. First, parents may be biased observers. Most parents do not have specialized training in language development, and may not be sensitive to subtle aspects of language structure and use. Further, a natural pride in the child and a failure to critically test their impressions may cause parents to overestimate the child’s ability (\\(\\mu_{c}\\)); conversely, frustration in the case of delayed language may lead to underestimates. Parent report is most likely to be accurate under three general conditions: (1) when assessment is limited to current behaviors, (2) when assessment is focused on emergent behaviors, and (3) when a primarily recognition format is used. Each of these conditions acts to reduce demands on the respondent’s memory, for example, parents are better able to report on their child’s language at the present than at times past and when their child is actively learning the particular words on the list (e.g., names for animals). Parent reports likely suffer from a number of biases that interact with sub-portions of the forms and the ages of the target children. For example, it is likely that parents may have more difficulty reporting on children’s comprehension or production of function words (e.g., so, then, if) than content words (e.g., baby, house)–relying more on their estimates of the words general difficulty (\\(d\\)). Moreover, in typically-developing samples, parents can track their child’s receptive vocabulary to about 16-18 months, after which it is too large to monitor. Expressive vocabulary can be monitored until about 2½ - 3 years, after which the number of words a child can say becomes too large.The CDI instruments capitalize on the greater ease of recognition, as contrasted with recall, to help offset these memory limitations. That is, it is better to ask parents to report on their child’s vocabulary by selecting words from a list of possible words rather than having them write down all the words they can recall hearing their child use (or, even worse, asking the global question: “Does your child know at least 50 words?”). In addition, asking parents to reflect on their child’s language abilities may be particularly difficult for early comprehension. As Tomasello and Mervis (1994) point out, for the youngest children, especially 8-10 month olds, vocabulary comprehension scores can be surprisingly high and likely implausible, possibly reflecting a lack of clarity in what the term “understands” means for parents of children at this young age. Third, there is some evidence that variability in reporting biases may be moderated by factors such as SES (Feldman et al. 2000; Larry Fenson et al. 2000; Feldman et al. 2005). Some studies suggest that parents from some SES groups may be more likely to underestimate child’s abilities (Roberts, Burchinal, and Durham 1999), while others report that parents from lower-SES groups may over-estimate children’s abilities, especially comprehension at younger ages [Goldfield and Reznick (1990); Feldman et al. (2000)). Later studies have shown that, for children over 2 years, patterns of validity were consistent in lower and higher-SES groups (Feldman et al. 2005; Reese and Read 2000). Thus, SES-differences could reflect valid delays in children’s language development that parallel those obtained with different methods, such as naturalistic observation or standardized tests (e.g., Hammer, Farkas, and Maczuga (2010)). A unique and important extension of this work for Wordbank is to examine the consistency of SES differences across a large number of languages and hence, language communities which may vary in the social impact of SES gradients. Fourth, the items on the original CDI instruments were chosen to be a representative sample of vocabulary for the appropriate age and language (L. Fenson et al. 1994). The checklists contain some words that most, including the youngest, children are able to understand or produce, some words that are understood or produced by the “average” child, and some which only children who are relatively more advanced will understand or produce. This structure ensures that the list has the psychometric property of capturing individual differences in vocabulary both across younger and older children and across children of different developmental levels. Validity of the CDIs has been demonstrated in reference to both standardized tests and naturalistic language sampling (see Chapter 4 of Larry Fenson et al. (2007)). Note that the checklists were not originally constructed with the intention that responses on individual items would be reliable. While item level responses provide useful information about patterns across children are likely to understand or produce, responses on the vocabulary checklist do not necessarily license the conclusion that a child would respond appropriately when asked “can you say ____?” by an experimenter in a confrontation naming task. Nonetheless, if parents’ observations at the item level reflect any signal–even in the context of significant influence from other factors–then this signal should be observable by aggregating together data from many children. Fifth, while the lengths of the vocabulary checklists on the CDIs may give the impression that they yield an estimate of the child’s full vocabulary, in fact the vocabulary size estimates only reflect a child’s relative standing compared to other children assessed with the same list of words(\\(i\\), see Mayor and Plunkett 2011 for discussion). Such estimates should not be misconstrued as a comprehensive estimate of the child’s vocabulary knowledge, as CDI scores likely understate the size of a child’s “true” vocabulary substantially, especially for older children (Mayor and Plunkett 2011). Moreover, while it is tempting to ask parents to indicate additional words that their child might be able to understand or say, users should be aware that including those items introduces bias in the estimates. In sum, despite these limitations, when used appropriately, the CDI instruments yield reliable and valid estimates of total vocabulary size. Because the instruments were designed to minimize bias by targeting current behaviors and asking parents about highly salient features of their child’s abilities, they have proven to be an important tool in the field, dozens of studies demonstrating concurrent and predictive relations with naturalistic and observational measures, in both typically-developing and at-risk populations (e.g., Dale and Fenson 1996; Thal, Jackson-Maldonado, and Acosta 2000; Marchman and Martínez-Sussmann 2002). In addition, a variety of recent work has shown that individual item-level responses can yield exciting new insights, for example about the growth patterns of semantic networks when aggregated across children (Hills et al. 2009; Hills et al. 2010). Such analyses have the potential to be even more powerful when applied to larger samples and across languages as they are within Wordbank. 1.4 Adaptations, not translations! Originally designed for English, parallel CDI instruments have now been adapted for more than 90 languages (http://mb-cdi.stanford.edu/adaptations.html), with data from 25 of those languages currently available in Wordbank. The ethic behind the development of these instruments is “adaptation, not translation” – in other words, to create forms with the same spirit as the English form, but not to simply translate the items. Instead, developers have been strongly encouraged to craft instruments that reflect the linguistic and cultural contexts that influence the early acquisition of vocabulary and other aspects of language in that particular language. While many words on the English-language checklist may easily translate to other languages, others will simply not be relevant within the same developmental time frame for children learning that new language, e.g., ‘cheese’ in Japanese or ‘snow’ in Arabic. Conversely, additional words may be needed in the new language which were not included on the English-language vocabulary checklist, e.g., ‘tortilla’ in Mexican Spanish. In all languages, the vocabulary checklists include words that appear earlier and later in normal development, as well as a similar proportion of words from different lexical classes, for example, nouns, verbs, adjectives, and so on. Taken individually then, each adapted instrument captures key trends in vocabulary development aggregated across all items on the respective checklists. Wordbank’s tools allow users to plot trends over age to model general developmental trends within that language, including median-level growth and estimates of the variation across individuals. Because data are also available at the item-level, Wordbank also allows analyses of developmental trajectories of individual items within each of the languages represented. IS THIS WHAT WE WANT TO DO HERE, i.e., DIRECT READERS TO WHERE ON THE WORDBANK SITE THEY COULD CONDUCT SUCH ANALYSES? Importantly, the breadth of the data in Wordbank enables many different cross-linguistic comparisons of vocabulary development. For example, by comparing proportions of words understood or produced across age, Wordbank can document the cross-language consistency in individual variability in rate of development (3.3) (NOT SURE IF WE DO THIS), gender differences (??), dissociations between comprehension and production (IS THIS INCLUDED?), early biases towards nouns over predicates and function words (??), relations between early communicative gestures and later receptive vocabulary (10), and close ties between vocabulary and grammar (11). Other analyses in Wordbank rely on translation equivalents being derived for individual checklist items. (See XXX for more information about the procedures implemented in Wordbank to create these translation equivalents.) OR DO WE WANT TO PUT MORE DETAIL HERE? Because the language lists were crafted specifically for each language by the individual developers, cross-language comparisons involve only the sub-set of items that are common across the different languages. Moreover, the set of available items may differ depending on the particular analysis. For example, in the case of GENDER? (??), only XX number of items have translation equivalents in a sufficient number of languages to enable comparison. Finally, even with the care used here to construct a robust set translation equivalents, individual items are likely to only be roughly equivalent crosslinguistically, and may have significantly different referential scopes for children learning the different languages. That is, if a parent indicates that a child can produce the word “dog” in English and another parent indicates the translation equivalent in, for example, Spanish (“perro”), it may nevertheless be the case that these words are heard more or less frequently and in different contexts in the two languages. An important empirical question is the degree to which translation equivalents across languages have consistent developmental profiles. DO WE HAVE ANY ANALYSES THAT ESTIMATE THE CONSISTENCY OF AGE OF ACQUISITION ACROSS LANGUAGES, NOT JUST IN THE PREDICTORS? Finally, due to variation in language structure and the interests of the developers of CDI adaptations, the CDI instruments vary in structure across languages. Most adaptations of the W&amp;G generally include gestures as well as vocabulary comprehension and production, however, it is not always the case (e.g., XXX). Further, while adaptations of the W&amp;S always include vocabulary production, not all instruments also contain some measures of grammar, for example, early use of closed-class morphology or combinatorial syntax (e.g., XXX). Note that linguistic differences render the structure and format of many parts of the grammar sections to be very different, and hence, not amenable to comparisons across languages. While there are inherent limitations in comparing different instruments across languages, Wordbank is the first package of computational tools that allows the exploration of both child- and item-level data within- and across such a large and diverse set of languages. As such, the availability of these adaptations remain at the core of the analyses that we offer within Wordbank. MORE HERE? IS ANYTHING MISSING IN THE ABOVE? Need to add sections/material on: + Limitations on cross-population comparison + Limitations on cross-linguistic comparison 1.5 Wordbank To take advantage of the opportunity posed by the broad use of CDI instruments in the child language community, in 2014 we began constructing Wordbank, an open repository for CDI data that allows for interactive analysis and visualization. Our inspiration for Wordbank came from two successful projects for sharing data on children’s language acquisition. The first is the Child Language Data Exchange System (CHILDES; MacWhinney 2000). A database of transcripts of children’s speech and speech to children, CHILDES has grown into a robust and important tool for the community, with many contributors and affiliated projects. The second is the Cross-Linguistic Lexical Norms site (CLEX; ; R. N. Jørgensen et al. 2010}), which is closer in content to Wordbank, and effectively our precursor. CLEX archives normative data from a range of CDI adaptations across languages, allowing browsing of acquisition trajectories for individual items or age groups. Wordbank builds on CLEX, offering the same functionality but allowing flexible and interactive visualization and analysis, as well as direct database access and data download. In addition, Wordbank’s goal was always to extend beyond normative data by dynamically incorporating data from many different researchers and projects of varying sizes and scopes. While the resulting datasets in Wordbank are much more heterogeneous than norming data, they are also larger and more representative than the individual norming datasets (in some cases), and available in languages where no norms exist (for others).

["methods.html", "2 Methods 2.1 Database Architecture 2.2 Data 2.3 Statistical Methods", " 2 Methods Our second chapter introduces descriptive facts about the dataset as well as details of data formatting and access using the wordbankr package (for the R statistical programming environment). Statistical Methods. Description of our approach to visualization and analysis, including specifications of the statistical models we use for quantifying effect sizes and comparing across studies.. Approach to cross-linguistic analysis. Since comparisons across languages are a key part of our contribution, we outline two different approaches that we use. We identify the difficulties in comparing across CDI forms (including across different languages and even across different forms in a single language). We provide some empirical analysis of how form length affects reporting. Every form an island. In this approach (EFAI), we compare scale-free measures of effect size across forms, not attempting to bridge the gaps between forms that have different items and different lengths (as well as being designed for different languages). Universal lemmas. We describe how, for a subset of languages, we identified and checked conceptual mappings that could be used to compare particular concepts across languages, which we call “universal lemmas” (ULs). Stuff about the CDI, data collection, population statistics… We use a number of shorthand terms throughout to make precise references to aspects of the CDI data. These are defined here. Instrument: A specific parent-report survey or questionnaire. Item: A particular question on an instrument. Includes words (with either produces or produces/understands responses), as well as other questions like questions about morphological or syntactic complexity. Administration: A particular instance of an instrument being given to a child. Child: A unique individual. Language: A particular language or language community for which an instrument has been adapted. Note that this definition of language distinguishes e.g. American and British English. 2.1 Database Architecture Example data from the CDI norming sample (Fenson et al., 2007). Each row has a unique child identifier, demographics, and word-by-word checklist data. Why use a database to store vocabulary data? Consider the standard format of raw CDI data. Here is a small slice of the original CDI norming data (L. Fenson et al. 1994; Larry Fenson et al. 2007). Each row is a child, each column gives a variable—either a demographic variable or the result of a particular word being administered to a particular child. Although this format is useful for homogeneous administrations of a single instrument, it cannot accommodate multiple instruments, multiple languages, or datasets with different sources or kinds of demographic information. Consolidating data across different instruments is very difficult in this format, and tracking data on children with multiple longitudinal administrations of a single instrument must also be done in an ad-hoc manner. The move to a database format allows far more flexible and programmatic handling of heterogeneous data structures from different sources. A relational database such as Wordbank is at its heart a series of tables linked by unique identifiers. There are two primary groups of tables in Wordbank. The common tables store data that is shared between CDI instruments, including information about administrations (individual instances of a form being filled out for a child), and items (words and other questions on a form). Then the instrument tables store response data for particular CDI instruments. We currently include all items on CDI instruments, including questions about communication, gesture, morphology, and grammar (though in many of the datasets that we archive these non-vocabulary questions have not been digitized so data on these are sparse at present; see Chapters ?? and ??). One strength of the Wordbank framework is that it allows the storage of subsidiary information about the words that are included in a particular instrument, so that this information can be used in future analyses. For example, information about grammatical and semantic categories or norms like concreteness and imageability could all be appended to particular words. This functionality is not yet present in Wordbank, however. The difficulty of compiling this kind of information for a particular set of words is compounded by the large number of languages that the database includes. We hope that in future this functionality will allow the gradual accumulation of information about the words included in the database. 2.1.1 A note on age Developmental psychologists are very fond of using temporal units like months and years as rough guides. Children tend to begin to crawl between 5 and 8 months, and say their first word around one year. This practice is fine for rules of thumb, but we also use these units for measurement as though they wre precise (e.g. “infants with ages between 7;0 and 8;0”) when in fact such infants will vary in the number of days since their birth depending on whether their seven months of life encompassed February or not. A similar problem is true of years (because of leap years) though the problem is less dire. Yet months are the currency of language development research, and we often receive contributed datasets with months alone reported. In Wordbank, we define a standardized month as 365.2524 / 12 = 30.4377 days. When possible, we compute the number of days from birth to testing and then compute the number of standardized months that the child has lived. We also define an eight-month-old (age == 8) as a child who has lived between 8 and 9 standard months: their age is in the range [8 - 9) standard months. 2.1.2 Implementation Wordbank is constructed using free, open-source tools. The database is a standard MySQL database, managed using Python and Django. Analysis apps are constructed using the Shiny package for R, an open-source statistical programming language. The code is hosted in a GitHub repository where interested users can browse, leave comments, and contribute modifications. All data uploaded to Wordbank are open and freely available for download, both through the site itself and through the GitHub repository. The site includes only de-identified data that cannot be linked to the parents and children who provided it. Because of these features, the Stanford Institutional Review Board has determined that the Wordbank project does not constitute human subjects research. 2.1.3 Cross-linguistic and cross-instrument architecture The general philosophy of the CDI has been summarized as “adaptation, not translation” [Dale (2015); see Chapter 1]. In other words, CDIs are a useful tool for many languages, but the forms differ between languages—words and even whole sections are added, dropped, and modified to ensure that the form captures the details of the particular language for which it is designed. To date, more than 60 adaptations of the original English CDI have been documented (Dale and Penfold 2011). These forms vary widely, including differences in length and intended age range. Some forms include hundreds of items more than the original 680 words on the English Words &amp; Sentences form; others are so-called ``short forms’’ and include only a hundred or a few hundred carefully selected words. Some are designed to capture development from the emergence of language through ages 3–4 years, while others are focused on very early development (like the English Words &amp; Gestures form, designed for ages 8–18 months). All of these differences make it problematic to compare scores and score distributions across forms, even using percentile ranks, since some instruments will have more or more difficult items than others. Wordbank is designed so that it can accommodate data from a wide variety of instruments, both within and across languages. Indeed, at the time of writing, the site includes data from more than 42,000 administrations of the CDI across 14 different languages and 24 different instruments. But because of the difficulties in comparison across instruments, our approach to cross-linguistic and cross-instrument data is to provide standardized analyses within each instrument and language, without assuming equivalence across words, instruments, or populations. Thus, our exploratory visualization tools in general do not allow comparison across languages and we urge users to interpret cross-linguistic and cross-instrument differences with caution.2 Developing statistical techniques to facilitate these comparisons is a current focus of our research. 2.1.4 “Unilemmas”: cross-linguistic conceptual mappings FIXME: note that unilemmas follow the “English is the language of thought” approach Some of our analyses require cross-linguistic comparison at the item level. For this purpose, we have created what we call “unilemmas” – “universal lemmas” – which are meant to be a rough-and-ready set of conceptual equivalences. We don’t have unilemmas for every language, yet, but we do have them for FIXME. Unilemmas were created using a two-step procedure. The first step consists of creating candidate mappings for lexical items on a particular form to the pool of unilemmas shared across other languages. This first step is often accomplished by a non-native speaker using translation resources and the context of the form (e.g., that an item occurs in the “animal sounds” section). The second step then involves checking by a native speaker of the language, using very specific directions, summarized below: We’re looking for the best English translation of these words. These are words that are among the first words that children learn, so your translation should be closest to the meaning of the word as it would be used by a young child (say, under 3 years old). For cases when there are two equally good English words, put both. If you don’t think there is a good translation into a reasonable English word that a kid might know, you can leave the alternative translation blank. 2.2 Data This section gives a broad overview of the data we have available. 2.2.1 Data Provenance Many languages are inherited from CLEX. Contributors are cited on the Wordbank contributors page. Importing is a process of standardizing idiosyncratic datasets into a common format. 2.2.2 Overview of the Data Wordbank curently has data from 25 language communities. Many of these are in the original Words &amp; Gestures (infant/toddler) / Words &amp; Sentences (child) format, with around 400 items in WG and 700 in the WS. Wordbank also includes some other forms that do not fit into this schema, including short forms and vocabulary questionnaires. Some of these are “short forms” with no internal category structure and fewer items overall. The number of administrations is variable across instruments and languages, however. 2.3 Statistical Methods We use medians instead of means. We use robust GLMs The only exception to this policy currently is that we allow users to see responses across instruments for individual words, in the Item Trajectories analysis (e.g., the proportion of children who say the word “cat” on both Words and Gestures and Words and Sentences forms).↩ "],
["vocab.html", "3 Vocabulary Development 3.1 Abstract 3.2 Variability in vocabulary development 3.3 Norms", " 3 Vocabulary Development 3.1 Abstract This chapter focuses on a particular view of the data, namely that each child is represented by a single vocabulary score: the proportion of words that child knows out of the total in the form. We begin by examining quantify the nature of variability across individuals and languages. We also note differences in form ceilings across languages. Then, the bulk of this chapter is devoted to different demographic predictors of vocabulary growth across languages (following the EFAI approach). We compare the effects of gender (female advantage), birth order (first-born advantage), and maternal education (socioeconomic status – SES – advantage). 3.2 Variability in vocabulary development One of the most important features of early vocabulary development is its variability (L. Fenson et al. 1994). Consider the English production data from the Words and Sentences form. It’s immediately clear that there is tremendous variability in vocabulary. Consider just a single age group, two-year-olds (24 months). The distribution of vocabularies across children is far from normally-distributed, with many children at the very bottom of the scale and almost as many at the top. Quite a few two-year-olds on their second birthday are producing only a handful of words (or at least their parents say they are) and others are producing more than 600 listed on the form, with the total number higher than that even.3 One way to describe these data is to consider the relationship of the variance to the central tendency. For example, in this age group, the mean productive vocabulary is 317 words, and the standard deviation is 175 words. But this distribution is far from normal (especially at the younger and older ages), so a non-parametric approach is warranted. We can compute the median absolute deviation from the median (MAD), which captures how far away values are from the median (a measure of variance, similar to the inter-quantile range or IQR) and divide by the median itself, giving us an intuitive sense of how the spread of the data relates to the central tendency. We’ll call this number the MMAD. In English production, this ratio is actually close to 1 from age one until almost age two, suggesting that the standard difference from the median is actually as big as the median itself! The decline begins before variability is substantially truncated by the ceiling of the form, suggesting that variability between kids is really highest before the second birthday. The same pattern is generally found across the languages in our database, with very high variance between the first and second birthdays. What does this MADM measure mean, exactly? It’s a non-parametric version of Cohen’s \\(d\\). In fact, they are very highly correlated. Imagine groups of three children. A group where one produced 30 words, one produced 100, and another produced 170 would have a MADM of 0.99. In contrast, one where they were more closely grouped – say 70, 100, 130 – would have a MADM of 0.44. The next figure shows MADM across languages and instruments. This similarity in variability structure is quite striking, such that between the first and second birthdays, language is remarkably variable. Below, we will use this variability as a way to measure the size of demographic effects. For example, how much variability is due to gender, compared with simple population variability? 3.3 Norms This set of analyses examines general patterns of vocabulary development. Here we examine general patterns of variability across languages. 3.3.1 Comprehension 3.3.2 Production Words and Gestures. Words and Sentences 3.3.3 Comparions of Variability on Comprehension and Production It will quickly get tiresome to acknowledge ceiling effects and parent report biases in every sentence, so we will acknowledge them up front and then mention them only when relevant throughout.↩ "],
["demographics.html", "4 Demographic Variables 4.1 MMAD method 4.2 ABC method", " 4 Demographic Variables We examine the patterns of vocabulary growth for individual demographic variables. To make these analyses work, we assume that all demographics interact with age in a simple way in the models, such that there is only one coefficient associated with the effect: age * demographic - demographic All of these analyses are carried out on production data. 4.0.1 Gender This analysis examines how vocabulary development differs by children’s reported gender, replicating and extending the results of: Eriksson, M., Marschik, P. B., Tulviste, T., Almgren, M., Pérez Pereira, M., Wehberg, S., … Gallego, C. (2012). Differences between girls and boys in emerging language skills: Evidence from 10 language communities. British Journal of Developmental Psychology 30, 326–343. An earlier version of this analysis was reported in M. C. Frank et al. (2016). Plot vocabulary size over age by gender. Get gender in terms of MMAD 4.0.2 Maternal education We use maternal education as a proxy for socio-economic status. 4.0.3 Birth order Only 7 languages have birth order data, and only 5 languages have it for WS. 4.0.4 Demographic effect sizes 4.1 MMAD method Demographics in terms of MMAD 4.2 ABC method How can we compare the size of these different demographic effects? One simple way to do so is to integrate the area between curves. The units for this analysis are arbitrary and (right now) can’t be compared across languages, since the curves have different lengths. To overcome this limitation, we’d need to look at First look at gender advantage. From this perspective it is quite clear that the Italian effect is anomalous. FIXME: what do we say about this?

["categories.html", "5 Categorical Composition: Syntax 5.1 Methods 5.2 Syntactic Vocabulary Composition 5.3 Age effects on vocabulary composition", " 5 Categorical Composition: Syntax The Categorical Composition of Early Vocabulary. This chapter focuses on splitting vocabulary data into syntactic and semantic categories and analyzing consistency and variability across languages in the acquisition of these. Syntactic category biases. We quantify the “noun bias” across languages. In addition, we report the degree of bias for or against verbs and closed-class words. Previously presented in Braginsky et al. (2015b). Conceptual categories. We investigate the consistency of colors, spatial terms, logical terms, and other conceptual categories of interest. Some of these semantic categories have been argued to be learned as a group, so we investigate whether they are more consistently correlated within children than would be expected by chance. An earlier version of this work was reported to BUCLD 2015 by Braginsky, Marchman, Yurovsky, &amp; Frank. Early vocabulary development is typically characterized by learning of names for caregivers and common objects, while later in development, children tend to diversify their vocabulary by increasing the proportion of predicates (verbs and adjectives) and closed class words. This over-representation of nouns has been found across a number of analyses and in a variety of languages (Bates et al. 1994; M. Caselli et al. 1995; Bornstein et al. 2004), though not all (Tardif 1996; Choi and Gopnik 1995). Differences in early vocabulary composition have been argued to emerge from typological differences (e.g., word order, subject drop), and from cultural practices (e.g., focus on picture book reading) (Tardif, Gelman, and Xu 1999; Gopnik, Choi, and Baumberger 1996; Choi and Gopnik 1995)—we are agnostic as to the source of this variability. Figure from Bates et al. (1994), showing developmental trends in the categorical composition of early vocabulary. 5.1 Methods Each CDI form contains a mixture of words in different classes. We adopt the categorization of Bates et al. (1994), splitting words into nouns, predicates (verbs and adjectives), function words, and other words. For each child’s vocabulary, we compute the proportion of the total words in each of these categories that they are reported to produce. For each of the four languages in our sample, we plot these proportions against total vocabulary. Each dot represents a child’s knowledge of a particular class, while curves show the relationship between a class and the whole vocabulary. If categories grow independently of one another, these curves should approximate the diagonal. This pattern is not what we observe, however: Across the languages in our sample, nouns are systematically over-represented in smaller vocabularies (shown by a curve that is above the diagonal), while function words—and to some extent, predicates—are under-represented. We limit our analysis to traditional WS and WG forms for now because short forms like the British English TEDS don’t have category information. The sample sizes included in this analysis are given below. 5.1.1 Estimation Method How do we estimate over-representation or under-representation of a particular vocabulary item? Function for resampling data and computing area estimate for each sample. Resample data and find the mean and CI of the area estimate. 5.2 Syntactic Vocabulary Composition Base plot for looking at vocabulary composition. 5.2.1 Production: Words and Sentences Plot WS productive vocabulary composition as a function of vocabulary size for each language. 5.2.2 Production: Words and Gestures Plot WG productive vocabulary composition as a function of vocabulary size for each language. These data are much sparser and don’t really license strong inferences in many cases. (Most children produce a relatively small number of the words on WG forms). ### Comprehension: Words and Gestures Plot WG receptive vocabulary composition as a function of vocabulary size for each language. 5.2.3 Summary across and measures Plot each lexical category’s area estimate by language, form, and measure. Plot WS production vocab composition proportions. 5.3 Age effects on vocabulary composition We predict that the proportion of predicates and function words in children’s vocabulary should be relatively more affected by age than nouns. Concrete nouns are hypothesized to be learned initially from both co-occurrences between words (Yu and Smith 2007) and by social cues to reference to particular objects (Bloom 2002). On neither account should syntactic information be a primary information source (though of course syntax might be more informative for abstract nouns). In contrast, for other types of words, syntax should be more important for learning their meaning. On the syntactic bootstrapping hypothesis (L. Gleitman 1990; Fisher et al. 2010), verbs especially are learned by mapping the syntactic structure of utterances to the thematic structure of observed events, for example by noticing that the subject of a sentence matches the agent in one particular ongoing event but not another (``the cat is fleeing the dog’’ matches flees(cat, dog) but not chases(dog,cat)). A similar argument can be made for adjectives, since identification of the modified noun is similarly critical for inferring the meaning of the modifier. And by the same logic, function words should be even harder to learn without some understanding of their syntactic role. Thus, if syntactic development is related in some way to age, we should see larger age effects on predicate and function word vocabulary than on noun vocabulary. In all four languages, the age coefficient is substantially larger for function words than for nouns. This asymmetry can be interpreted as evidence that, for two vocabulary-matched children, the older child would tend to produce relatively more function words than the younger. "],

While these single word utterances sometimes seem to be picking out objects in the world (e.g., ball!), others seem to convey more complex ideas or desires (e.g., up! for Mommy, pick me up!). But by two years of age, many children have acquired a large repertoire of words, and are beginning to use them in two- or three-word combinations (e.g., Mommy up! or kitty sleep here). These utterances will gradually increase in length and complexity in various ways, forming sentences that increasingly reflect the grammatical structure of their native language (e.g., Mommy, the kitty is sleeping here). Children also begin to add more verbs, adjectives and other predicates to their working vocabularies, and substantively increase their use of prepositions, articles and other closed class forms that do grammatical work, including the productive use of inflectional morphemes (e.g., English past tense ed or ing). Understanding the origins of grammar is critical because children’s ability to use morphosyntactically-rich language is thought to reflect the uniquely-human mental machinary that enables speakers to produce novel utterances that have never been heard in the input (Berko (1958), (???)). The questions surrounding the development of grammar are challenging. How do abstract morphosyntactic structures emerge during language learning? What mechanisms underlie the formation of generalizations that support such inferences and allow children to apply them during language production? Does an understanding of the abstract rule-structure of language emerge from the interactions of individual words, or is that structure independently acquired and represented separately? Broadly speaking, theoretical views on grammatical development generally take one of two forms. On nativist theories like principles and parameters (Chomsky 1981; Baker 2005), grammar emerges independently from lexical knowledge following its own, largely maturational, timetable. Moreover, grammatical regularities are mentally represented in a format that is distinct from that used by the lexical system. In contrast, according to lexicalist theories, mental representations of morphosyntactic structure generally emerge from graded generalizations on the basis of lexical items, and at least early in development, there may be little or no representation of morphosyntactic rules or regularities per se (Tomasello 2003, Elman et al. (1996)). Even when syntactic structures are eventually represented, these representations are directly related to more concrete lexical structures (Bannard, Lieven, and Tomasello 2009). Historically, the study of individual differences has been critial to this debate. While variation in word learning is generally uncontroversial, individual differences in grammatical development is less clearly aligned with a universalist, nativist perspective. In contrast, lexicalist theories predict that variation in grammatical development should be tightly yoked to variation in lexical development (Bates and Goodman 1999). Research has shown that, as with lexical development, there is sizeable variation in exactly when and how children move into using more grammatically complex utterances in their everyday speech. While some children use primarily multi-word phrases and many closed class forms by 24 months, other children are still primarily producing nouns in single word utterances at that same age (e.g., (???); Bates and Goodman (1999)). Moreover, there is also variation in the kinds of multi-word utterances that children produce. For example, some children build up sentences from individual words (e.g., want dat!), whereas, other children seem to produce utterances that reflect “unanalyzed” chunks of more complex speech (e.g., iwantdodat!). Critically, associations between individual differences in lexical and grammatical development have been robustly substantiated in the literature. Based on the original norming data from the English CDI: Words &amp; Sentences, children with more sophisticated grammatical productions were also those children with the largest vocabularies (Bates et al. (1994)). Using that same dataset, Marchman and Bates (1994) found that size of verb vocabulary was concurrently related to children’s overregularization of past tense inflections (e.g., daddy goed), productions that are viewed as a major milestone in the development of grammatical rule-based knowledge.

Links between lexical development and grammar have also been reported longitudinally ((???); Bates and Goodman (1997)), in late talkers (e.g., Paul, 1996, 1997; Rescorla &amp; Schwartz, 1993; Rescorla, Roberts &amp; Dahlsgaard, 1997, 2000; Thal &amp; Tobias, 1994; Thal &amp; Katich, 1996), early talkers (Thal, Bates, Zappia &amp; Oroz, 1996; Thal, Bates, Goodman, &amp; Jahn-Samilo, 1997), and children with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Williams syndrome (e.g., Singer-Harris, Bellugi, Bates, Jones, &amp; Rossen, 1997). Critically, similar relationships have also been demonstrated in many other languages, including Slovenian (Marjanovic-Umek, Fekonja-Peklaj, &amp; Podlesek, 2013), Hebrew (Maital, Dromi, Sagi, &amp; Bornstein, 2000), Icelandic (Thordardottir, Ellis Weismer, &amp; Evans, 2002), Italian (C. Caselli, Casadio, and Bates (1999); (???)), Bulgarian (Andonova, 2015), Finnish (e.g., (???)), Turkish (Turkay, 2013), Spanish (e.g., Mariscal &amp; Gallego, 2012; Thal, Jackson-Maldonado, and Acosta (2000)), and German (Szagun, Steinbrink, Franik, &amp; Stumper, 2006). Finally, strong heritability of the relation between lexical and grammatical level has been documented in behavioral genetic studies of monozygotic and dizygotic twins ((???)). In other words, even though genetic factors contribute relatively weakly to each aspect of language assessed individually, the genetic factors that influence lexical growth are the same as those that influence grammatical growth. COULD ADD BILINGUALS? While these studies substantiate that vocabulary and grammar development are strongly associated developmentally, the interpretation of these relations is still under debate. Some researchers have interpreted these links to suggest that domain-general learning mechanisms guide the child’s construction of a working linguistic system at many different levels, in this case, learning words and learning grammatical rules (e.g., Bresnan, Tomasello, Elman et al., 1996). As Bates and MacWhinney proposed many years ago, “the native speaker learns to map phrasal configurations onto propositions, using the same learning principles and representational mechanisms needed to map single words onto their meanings” ((???), p. 163). Other proposals suggest that the process of learning words involves learning both their lexical-semantic and their morphosyntactic properties (e.g., in what constructions they can legally appear and what inflectional morphemes are required). Other theories propose that grammatical knowledge is built up on a case-by-case basis. Early word combinations are often highly routinized and situation specific, suggesting that learning grammar, like word learning, is guided by learning mechanisms that are item specific and frequency dependent. It is only later that grammatical structures become encoded in terms of their abstract syntactic form (e.g. Akhtar, 1999; Lieven, Pine &amp; Baldwin, 1997; Tomasello, 2001). Finally, yet another accounts views the relation as reflecting mechanisms that operate in the opposite direction. Grammatical analysis is a driving force behind word learning, such that the process of analyzing sentences into their constituent grammatical parts facilitates the further acquisition of lexical-semantic knowledge (Anisfeld, Rosenberg, Hoberman &amp; Gasparini, 1998; Gleitman, 1990; (???)). 11.2 Goals of the current analyses In this chapter, we explore relations between estimates of children’s vocabulary size based on the vocabulary checklist and responses on other sections of the Words and Sentences instruments. Many versions of the instruments provide indices of grammar learning by asking about children’s use of inflected forms (e.g., walked), children’s use of overgeneralizations (e.g., goed), and the complexity of their word combinations (e.g., kitty sleeping / kitty is sleeping). While many studies have examined associations between lexical and grammatical development crosslinguistically, the scope and power of these early studies were limited, relying on relatively small norming samples (1000–2000 children) with few opportunities for direct comparisons of the nature or extent of these relations across multiple languages at the same time. The data available in Wordbank allows analyses of lexical-grammar relations with enhanced statistical power and broader cross-linguistic representation. In addition, we explore a hypothesis that was not explicitly tested in these earlier studies: that there remains age-related variance in grammatical development unexplained by vocabulary development. While the overall relationship between grammar and the lexicon provides support for lexicalist theories, the identification of age-related variance would suggest the presence of developmental processes that regulate grammar learning, above and beyond those captured by measures of vocabulary size. Such age-related processes could be either maturational or experiential, and either domain-general (like working memory) or language-specific (like grammatical competency). Importantly, since both nativist and constructivist theories could in principle predict age-linked variance in grammatical development, our goal is not to differentiate these theories, but instead to test this novel prediction and explore its implications for future work on understanding the processes of grammatical development. An additional contribution of work is that, due to the size of our dataset, we are able to make more fine-grained distinctions than the initial cut between grammar and the lexicon. In particular, we distinguish morphology from multi-word syntax, since morphological generalizations might be more specifically dependent on vocabulary size than those requiring more global, sentence-level syntactic regularities. Similarly, we distinguish age-related contributions to different parts of the vocabulary. Lexical items like verbs and even more so function words require some syntactic information to learn (L. Gleitman 1990) and hence might be more linked to age-related factors that extend beyond vocabulary size. 11.3 Methods In all 4 languages, the CDI forms contain both vocabulary checklists and other questions relevant to the child’s linguistic development. All of the data reported here come from the Words &amp; Sentences form, administered to children ages 16–32 months. Each of these instruments includes a Vocabulary section, which asks whether the child produces each of around 700 words from a variety of semantic and syntactic categories (e.g., foot, run, so); a Word Form section, which asks whether the child produces each of around 30 morphologically inflected forms of nouns and verbs (e.g., feet, ran); and a Complexity section, which asks whether the child’s speech is most similar to the syntactically simpler or more complex versions of around 40 sentences (e.g., two foot / two feet, there a kitty / there’s a kitty). Each language’s instrument is not just a translation of the English form, but rather was constructed and normed to reflect the lexicon and grammar of that language. To analyze lexical and grammatical development, we derive several measures. Each child’s Vocabulary Size is computed as the proportion of words on the corresponding CDI form that the child is reported to produce. Similarly, each child’s Word Form score is the proportion of word forms they are reported to produce, and their Complexity score the proportion of complexity items for which they are reported to use the more complex form. We compute all of these quantities as proportions to make the scales comparable across languages. Show number of items in each relevant section. Some utility functions for transforming data values. Note the hack of thinking of everything that’s not complexity as being word form. Also - some complexity categories are not coded. 11.4 Grammar and the lexicon Get kid by item data for wordform and complexity items all languages and aggregate them. Get by kid summary data for all languages. Plot score as a function of vocabulary size for each language and measure with model prediction curves. Note that cubic clms don’t work that well here. By two years, most children have a sizable working vocabulary, including verbs, prepositions, and closed class forms that perform grammatical work. They are also beginning to use multi-word combinations (e.g., mommy sock) and may demonstrate productive use of inflectional morphemes (e.g., past tense -ed). Previous studies have found a strong connection between the size of the lexicon and grammatical development as measured by the Complexity section, in many languages including English, Italian, Hebrew, and Spanish (see Bates and Goodman 1999). However, no studies have had the power and cross-linguistic representation to go beyond this initial finding to explore relations to grammatical items that vary in morphosyntactic features. We extend this work by examining grammatical development using two measures: the Word Form checklist as a window into morphology and the Complexity checklist as a window into syntax. For each measure, we investigate the effects of vocabulary size and age. This suggests that the mechanisms guiding vocabulary and grammar learning are highly interdependent (Tomasello 2003; Bresnan 2001), a view at odds with the nativist assumption that grammar emerges independent of the lexicon (Chomsky 1981). We wanted to estimate how much variance in children’s syntactic and morphological development remains after accounting for that child’s vocabulary size. Specifically, we asked whether age provides additional predictive power beyond vocabulary size. To estimate this effect, we fit logistic regression models to each child’s Word Form and Complexity scores, predicting score as a function of vocabulary size and age in months. For all languages and measures, the evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of the model using both vocabulary and age as predictors, as compared to the model using only vocabulary (the smallest difference in AIC is 76). Figure~ shows data and models: each dot represents a child’s score on a measure, while curves show the relationship between score and vocabulary size. %As seen most clearly for English and Norwegian—the languages for which we have most data— For all languages, the curves for Word Form are near-overlapping, showing little differentiation across age groups. This indicates only small contributions of age above and beyond vocabulary. In contrast, the curves for Complexity show a characteristic fan across age groups, indicating that the relationship between vocabulary size and complexity score is modulated by age. %The Spanish and Danish data show less of a clear complexity curve fan, possibly because of the relatively small number of data points in the youngest age group. Choosing cut points here is hard, since the age distribution/density is different from language to language. Because of the size of our samples, all main effects and interactions are highly significant. To assess the extent of the age contribution to children’s morphological and syntactic development, we compared the coefficients of Word Form and Complexity models. Figure~ shows the coefficient of the age effect for each measure across languages. In each language, the age effect coefficient is substantially larger for Complexity than Word Form, indicating a greater age effect on those items that generally align with syntax than morphology. Given the heterogeneous nature of the CDI instruments, particularly in the Complexity sections, we further broke down these items by classifying them as capturing more morphological or more syntactic phenomena. Items for which the difference between the simple and complex sentences is in the inflection of a noun or verb (such as ) were coded as Morphological. The remainder of the items were coded as Syntactic, since they involve the use of some sentence-level syntactic construction (such as ). We then fit predictive models as above separately for every item. Figure shows the age effect coefficient of each item. In general, there is a three-way split: age effects are smallest for Word Form items, then Morphological Complexity items, and largest for Syntactic Complexity items, suggesting more syntactic phenomena have greater age contributions. Building on previous analyses that showed a strong relationship between lexical and grammatical development, we added age into this relationship. Across languages, our measures of syntactic development consistently showed greater age modulation than measures of morphological development. Further distinguishing between items that were more reflective of morphology than syntax, we again found greater age effects for more syntactic items. Thus, this analysis provides evidence for a relationship between syntactic development and age captured by lexical development. 11.5 Discussion The current study revisits classic findings but also explores novel questions regarding lexicon-grammar relations and vocabulary composition through Wordbank, a newly-developed web-based tool for cross-linguistic analyses of large CDI datasets. Our results provided general support for a lexicalist view, in that, in 4 languages, variance in vocabulary production strongly aligned with variance in grammar. However, we also estimated additional age-related contributions, specifically contrasting the links to morphological forms vs. syntactic constructions, and for different lexical categories. In general, we find that measures of grammar that are more closely aligned with syntax are modulated by age to a greater extent than those reflecting inflectional morphology. Also, we find that the trajectories of predicate and function word representation in the vocabulary are modulated by age to a greater extent than noun representation (albeit with some variability across languages). Both findings suggest a place for developmental processes that facilitate grammatical acquisition beyond pure lexical growth. Our analyses suggest interesting new areas of research regarding possible mechanisms driving children’s early lexical development and how those mechanisms might support children’s transition from single words to more morphosyntactically complex utterances. One possibility is that these developments are dependent on maturational factors that operate on grammatical development in a domain-specific way, independent of lexical-semantic processes. Another possibility is that age-related effects represent more domain-general learning mechanisms, such as attention or working memory, that provide differential support for sentence-level processes than word-internal ones . Future studies should also explore the extent to which lexical and age-related processes are shaped, either independently or in tandem, by features of the learning environments that children experience &lt;e.g.,&gt;{weisleder2013}. Questions about the nature of morphosyntactic representations in early language have often seemed deadlocked. But by mapping out developmental change across large samples and multiple languages, our findings here challenge theories across the full range of perspectives to more fully describe the mechanistic factors underlying the interaction of vocabulary, grammar, and development.

These analyses have revealed both striking variability across our units of sampling – children, primarily, but also words and even languages – but they have also revealed substantial consistency. In this conclusion we discuss the interplay and tension between these two ideas, variability and consistency, and how they interact with and inform theoretical conceptions of language acquisition more broadly. 12.1 Summary Observations 12.1.1 Variability Beginning with the first monograph reporting the CDI norming study, L. Fenson et al. (1994) noted that variability is perhaps the primary and most striking fact about children’s vocabulary learning. In Chapter 3, we quantified this variability and found that – across languages and spanning children’s second year – the variability was as large as the central tendency. In practical terms, the huge variance across children accounts for the fact that while some typically-developing two year olds will talk your ear off, others will barely utter a handful of words (even if they understand more). From a biological perspective, this variability is quite unprecedented. As a comparison, variation in heights for toddlers is tiny compared with variation in vocabulary: the mean height for a 24-month-old is around 33 inches, with a standard deviation of a little more than an inch, leading to a coefficient of variation around .03. This measurement is almost two orders of magnitude smaller than the coefficient of variation on vocabulary. 12.1.2 Consistency How can we describe and explain this variability? While much of the variance in the distribution of children remains unexplained, we still observe some striking correlates that can provide In this sense, our work here follows what we might call the “Batesian program,” the use of large-N data from the CDI to identify consistent developmental patterns that give clues to the organization of the mechanisms of language acquisition. To provide grounding to our discussion, we review consistencies below: Demographic differences. In Chapter 3, we explored demographic differences in vocabulary. With very limited exceptions, we see a consistent advantage for girls over boys in early word learning across languages. Similarly, across (a smaller set of) languages, children with earlier birth orders are reported to have larger vocabularies. Both of these demographic differences should be considered in light of the probability of reporting biases – for example, parents might expect girls to have larger vocabularies and hence report more words on average (though perhaps the consistency of the female advantage is surprising given variation in gender biases and stereotypes across countries, e.g., Nosek et al. 2009). We return to the issue of difficulties in causal inference below. Coefficient of Variation Variability across kids (size of the fan) FIXME Category biases. In Chapter 5, we extend previous work (e.g., Bornstein et al. 2004) by quantifying the degree of bias for and against different word classes in early vocabulary. For example, with a handful of exceptions (discussed in depth in that chapter) we see a bias for the overrepresentation of nouns in early vocabulary, at the expense of predicates and, even more so, function words. Individual words. Following Tardif et al. (2008), we show that there are large similarities in the most common early words. Further, we show that the predictors of what words are easier and harder across langauges are extremely consistent. Grammar and the lexicon. Following Bates and Goodman (1997), we show the tight developmental correlations between the growth of grammatical complexity in children’s early language and the growth of their vocabulary. 12.1.3 Limitations All of our analyses are fundamentally correlational. No causal inferences from Wordbank data are possible. We’ll say this again so you know we mean it: no causal inferences are possible. All of the consistencies described above admit alternative causal explanations. For example, as noted, parents could think that girls speak more and hence report more words for girls. Or girls could actually know more words. Similarly, first-born children could receive more language input due to the lack of other competition for parents’ attention, and hence have larger vocabulary. Or parents could be aware of more of first-born children’s vocabulary. Or both. As in the gender case, external data can provide evidence for or against particular causal explanations but in their absence we are left to speculate. For more cognitive consistencies that we observe, alternative causal interpretations are again possible. To take one example, the “noun bias” could result from any of the following causal mechansisms (as well as mixtures of these, or mixtures of these and others not described): * children could learn nouns more easily due to their social/referential disambiguation relative to the syntactic disambiguation (L. Gleitman 1990; Gillette et al. 1999); * they could be learned more easily due to their conceptual transparency (???); * they could be reported more frequently by parents due to some feature, such as their imageability or concreteness; * etc. Nevertheless, an observed pattern of correlations can still create a target for theory. As we noted in the introduction, observing what “hangs together” in development can provide clues to the underlying system (???). We think of these correlations as loose targets for theorists: a successful theory can gain support by providing an account for these observations. But what kinds of theories can these observations differentiate? Figure 12.1: A caricature of the traditional theoretical space in langauge acquisition research. Theorizing in language acquisition has traditionally argued on the axes defined by the nativist/empiricist debate, as well as the debate between domain-general and domain-specific representations and mechanisms. We label the implied axis of the debate here as the continuum between domain-general, empiricist theories and domain-specific, nativist theories. Anchoring one side of this continuum are statistical learning theories, that posit that domain-general mechanisms that learn structure from continuous input can induce structure from linguistic input [CITES: rethinking innateness, etc.]. On the other side are content-nativist theories that posit language-specific representational structures, such as the Principles and Parameters theory (Chomsky 1981, Baker (2005)). For all the reasons described above, we do not believe that the observed consistencies directly bear on traditional questions of the mechanisms underlying language acquisition. Taking the correlation between grammar and the lexicon as a case study: theoretical proposals from many parts of the space shown in Figure 12.1 can account for these data. For example, a purely bottom-up statistical generalization mechanism would clearly produce a correlation between lexical and grammatical structure (as in Bates and Goodman 1997’s original propopsal); statistical generalizations require lexical data and so more data should correlate with more generalization. But a more domain-specific nativist grammatical proposal might also produce this correlation, provided that it required triggering data (e.g., ???, (???)). And many variations in between. So what do these data tell us? 12.1.4 Ruling out methodological alternatives One important class of explanations that limits our ability to make generalizations is explanations of our observations that rely on data regarding the process of gathering CDI data itself, whether they relate to: the design process for the CDI, e.g., biases on the selection of words to be included in a form; the sampling process for families, e.g., biases on backgrounds of families within and across samples; the reporting process, e.g., biases regarding particular types of children (e.g., girls) or particular types of words (e.g., function words); To rule out these explanations, we need to rely on the existence of converging evidence for the same effects from other sources. Some of these sources are cited in the original chapters, but we briefly review them here. Gender [Probably in the original CDI/gender paper, look for references?] Birth order [??] Noun bias [bornstein study, others cited in that chapter?] Grammar/Lexicon [??] Predictor consistency (at least Huttenlocher et al. 1991, maybe others for frequency. harder for babiness, etc.) In sum, for many of our proposed consistencies, we can begin to muster evidence against them from convergent sources. Nevertheless, much more work is needed to measure the size (not just the direction) of these effects and compare effect size across different measurements. For example, if the same size gender effect were found in the same population with both parent report and pointing-based methods, this finding would provide evidence against a parent-reporting bias account of gender differences. This high standard has yet to be met for most of the findings we report. 12.2 Consistency in Variability BORNSTEIN QUOTE Weaker claim - the same variability is there across cultures/languages. DEMOGRAPHIC EXAMPLE - SES is variable, gender is consistent Relationship between size and variability should be informative A call to action to care about size and variability Measurement 12.3 Process Universals NEW AXIS FIGURE VARIABLE CONSISTENT &lt;—————————————&gt; SES / NOUN BIAS GRAMMAR/LEX COV GENDER CULTURE/LANGUAGE COGNITION Assuming that we can rule out reporting biases, the consistencies we observe across languages point to putative universals: generalizations that hold across very disparate populations of human children learning typologically distinct languages. Surely such universals should be an important basis for theorizing about language acquisition. A theory that accounted for such universals “for free” – as a result of basic assumptions about the nature of the learning mechansisms – would be able to claim more and broader evidence, for example. What is the nature of these putatitive universals? By virtue of the learning problem that they arise from, they cannot be universals of content. A child’s vocabulary is made up of individual words, each arising from a set of specific interactional circumstances (e.g., the trip to the zoo where a giraffe was seen for the first time). And each of these words is – of course – specific to a particular language. Thus, there is no viable sense in which any possible universals for vocabulary learning can be content universals: no particular content of this type could be innately given. For this reason, we describe these as “process” universals: they relate to the process by which each individual extracts a lexicon from their own idiosyncratic linguistic experiences. To examine whether there is content to the claim of process universals, it is helpful to consider the alternative hypothesis. One alternative is that the process of language acquisition is specific and particular, rather than universal. Two prominent particulars pull against universal tendencies. The first is the vast semantic and syntactic variation across the world’s languages. For example, as illustrated by (???) and others, languages vary dramatically in the ways that they assign semantic content to verbs. If the semantic partition of verbs led to large-scale differences in the timeline or mechanism of acquisition, we might see systematic differences in the predictors of age of acquisition for verbs in these languages, yet we do not. Further, languages are more and less morphologically complex; while the most morphologically-complex, polysynthetic languages are not represented in Wordbank, we do have data from both Mandarin (less complex) and Russian (more complex). If morphosyntax were relatively more or less important in the acquisition of particular languages, we might expect radical differences in the noun bias, the grammar-lexicon correlation, or the predictors of age of acquisition across languages, yet we do not observe these. Of course, there is always room for finer-grained predictions – with more detailed predictive models and better typological coverage, perhaps we will discover such signatures. Our point here is merely that neither morphosyntactic nor semantic variability across languages dominates the process of vocabulary acquisition. The second set of language-specific particulars that might lead to variance across languages is the vast cultural variability across the communities represented in the Wordbank data. With N continents represented, we see both “individualist” and “collectivist” cultures (???,(???)) as well as both “loose fit” and “tight fit” cultures (???). To the extent that parenting differs across these – and there is good evidence that it does [CITES] – we should see variance in the trajectory of language learning. For example, as mentioned previously, it would be quite reasonable to predict that the female advantage in vocabulary acquisition might vary as a function of cross-national gender biases (Nosek et al. 2009). Yet it is strikingly consistent overall, again arguing that – at the broadest level, at least – cultural factors do not dominate other child-internal processes in the acquisition of vocabulary. QUANTITATIVE PREDICTIONS: if language moves your signature mean then you are a particular, not a universal - SES - noun bias Claims of universals should always be taken with a grain of salt. In our case, a variety of caveats apply, from the relatively limited sample size N = 25 (see Piantadosi and Gibson 2014 for guidance on claims about strict universals) to the strong Indo-European bias amongst the languages in the database. At best our claim is of a statistical universal rather than an absolute universal. In addition, nearly all of our data come from populations in relatively industrialized nations (cf. Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan 2010). FURTHER CAVEATS 12.3.1 What is a Process? IT’S ABOUT LEARNING - UPTAKE OF INPUT COGNITIVE COMPONENTS, PROCESSING SPEED, ATTENTION, GENERALIZATION, LEARNING UNFOLDING OVER TIME - IT’S FUNDAMENTALLY DEVELOPMENTAL, ABOUT THE WAY THAT KNOWLEDGE ACCUMULATES IN THE CONTEXT OF CHIlD AND ENVIRONMENT BRONFENBRENNER-ESQ 12.3.2 Speculations about Process What sort of developmental process of vocabulary learning could lead to these universals? Any claim of this sort must be very speculative. If pushed, we would point to the following (weak) proposals regarding processes that are consistent with some of our putative universals. Demographic differences are – at least – consistent with interactional-input theories of vocabulary development (Hart and Risley 1995,Hoff (2003),Weisleder and Fernald (2013)) in which the more and higher-quality the input the child receives, the faster vocabulary grows. Under this hypothesis, first-born, female, and higher-maternal education children all are likely to receive more and higher-quality input: female children through the route of their somewhat greater social/interactional abilities (an extra assumption), first-born children through their greater allocation of parent attention, and high maternal-education children through greater parental awareness of the role of input, differering parental practices, and greater amount of leisure time to spend with children among other factors. Both the noun bias and the age-of-acquisition prediction results are consistent with the broader cross-situational viewpoint on acquisition (L. Smith and Yu 2008,L. Gleitman (1990)). On this view, nouns are easy to learn because the more they are heard, the more opportunities children get to build consistent mappings between the words and their referents. In contrast, verbs and other predicates rely more on a base of nouns and a basic comprehension of the syntactic structures in which they appear in order to infer meaning in context. Thus they should be acquired relatively later and with relativel more support from shorter, easier-to-parse utterances (MLU as a predictor, for example). Cross-linguistic exceptions will tend to be for languages like Mandarin where many early-learned verbs are semantically-transparent enough to be learned cross-situationally. Correlations between grammar and the lexicon, as well as the greater role of MLU in predicting acquisition of function words are both consistent with views that posit gradual syntactic abstraction and generalization. Versions of such viewpoints exist throughout the broad theoretical space of language acquisition (???,Tomasello (2003),(???)), but all proposals rely on a learning mechanism in which generalizations about structure are graded and rely on the amount of evidence available. 12.3.3 Local vs. Global Processes Back to the slobin/competition model argument. Are some languages harder to learn than others. At some level yes, Danish is really hard (???) We’re not trying to argue against the data on spanish clitics or agglutinatives in russian. On the other hand, the general developmental course is consistent. And degree of variation. The universal is in the general aspects, not the details. 12.4 Concluding Remarks Wordbank embodies our belief that scale is in itself transformative. The existence of a noun bias is a fascinating observation, but this observation gives limited leverage to differentiate theories. The magnitude of a noun bias provides more leverage for quantiative theorizing. And the distribution of magnitudes across many of the world’s languages gives greater leverage still. Our hope is that, by generalizing and applying many influential analyses by many contributors, our work here can affect theory more broadly. More ABOUT POWER TO MEASURE MEAN AND VARIANCE Developmental psychology often appears to be divided between two groups that do not communicate with one another. On the one hand, there are researchers interested in the ontogenetic and phylogenetic origins of knowledge – the epistemological project of understanding how we reason about objects, communicate using language, or learn from other people (???, (???), (???)). On the other hand, there are researchers interested in growth, change, and variation across individuals in psychometric constructs like executive function, working memory, and personality (???, other cites). The first type of research has led to a productive union of philosophical and psychological ideas, addressing many of the most exciting questions in the history of philosophy using empirical methods (???, (???)). The second type has had success in its connections to educational policy (???,(???), others?). In many areas of research, these two traditions have little interchange with one another. They read different journals, record different measures, use different research designs and statisical models, and often appear to be pursuing entirely different goals. Yet language learning is an area where these traditions come together. The knowledge being acquired – the stock of words in the child’s lexicon – is both the epistemic construct whose origins we are studying and the psychometric construct whose reliability across individuals we wish to assess. By studying the variability and consistency in the early lexcion, we can both study the origins of knowledge and the processes and factors by which human beings differ from one another across different cultural contexts, family environments, and genetic endowments.
