In this part, we focus on demographic differences in the learning of individual words. Braginsky et al. (2016b) reported on gender differences in the particular words in early vocabulary; we generalize this analysis to birth order and socio-economic status 8.2 Predicting Which Words are Harder or Easier AOA PRED Predicting early learning. Braginsky et al. (2016a) provides an analysis in which independent data sources (including transcripts of child-directed speech) are brought to bear as predictors of acquisition differences between words. This “age of acquisition prediction” model allows us to quantify the consistency and variability in predictor values across languages for particular words, using the UL approach to cross-linguistic analysis. By-item stuff like overall item trajectories, gender-input, and uni_lemma based cross-linguistic consistency things. "]
