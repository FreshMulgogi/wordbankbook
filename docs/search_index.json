These analyses have revealed both striking variability across our units of sampling – children, primarily, but also words and even languages – but they have also revealed substantial consistency. In this synthetic chapter we begin by presenting a set of analyses of the empirical consistency and variability of specific phenomena. We then discuss the interplay and tension between these two ideas, variability and consistency, and how they interact with and inform theoretical conceptions of language acquisition more broadly. 15.1 Measuring variability and consistency In each of the substantive chapters of this book (roughly speaking from Chapter 5 to 14), we have presented analyses of specific phenomena of theoretical interest. Wherever possible, we have generalized these analyses across languages so that their relative consistency can be examimined and discussed. The goal of the current analysis is to bring together these analyses into a single meta-analysis (in the general sense, not the specific statistical sense). This strategy executes the general idea discussed in Chapter 1. Our analyses identify “signatures” of language development that have been central to theoretical discussion. We then quantify these signatures numerically and measure their variation across languages. The resulting quantities are an empirically-derived measure of which aspects of language development appear more similar across different languages and contexts. We discuss the types of inferences licensed and not licensed by these analyses below. 15.1.1 Methods Each measure for which we compute the CV will have both a different base unit and a different number of languages contributing. For example, when considering the correlation between grammar and the lexicon (Chapter 13), we will be looking at the CV of a set of correlations with one specific set of languages contributing. When we look at the size of the noun bias (Chapter 11) we will be looking at a group of bias estimates that have different units and a different set of languages. Thus, caution is warranted in interpreting these variability estimates, even as we believe that they are informative. To assist in interpretation, we exclude measures that can be computed in fewer than 7 languages; provide the N contributing languages for all analyses; and compute an estimate of the standard error of the CV (\\[SEM \\approx CV / \\sqrt{2N}\\]). We begin by identifing a small number of measures computed in each chapter to serve as the “signatures” to be promoted into this analysis. For each measure, we compute its cross-linguistic variability using a standardized measure of variance, the coefficient of variation (CV, the standard deviation divided by the mean). This measure can range from 0 (with a phenomenon completely invariant across languages) to infinity (with higher numbers indicating greater variation). These CV values provide a single common measure to allow comparability of otherwise very different quantities, allowing inferences across analyses and datasets – albeit with some cautions that we describe below. Each measure for which we compute the CV will have both a different base unit and a different number of languages contributing. For example, when considering the correlation between grammar and the lexicon (Chapter 13), we will be looking at the CV of a set of correlations with one specific set of languages contributing. When we look at the size of the noun bias (Chapter 11) we will be looking at a group of bias estimates that have different units and a different set of languages. Thus, caution is warranted in interpreting these variability estimates, even as we believe that they are informative. To assist in interpretation, we exclude measures that can be computed in fewer than 7 languages; provide the N contributing languages for all analyses; and compute an estimate of the standard error of the CV (\\(SEM \\approx CV / \\sqrt{2N}\\)). The measures we include in this analysis are necessarily a subjectively-determined subset of the possible measures we have examined in the book. And of course those in turn are a subset of the measures we could have computed. Wherever possible we have attepted to make reasonable decisions, but some of these are by necessity somewhat arbitrary. An example of such a decision comes from the summary of Chapter 5. In that chapter we noted that population variability appears quite consistent across languages. We summarised population variability in production via a statistic, MMAD – but what is the appropriate range of ages to include in a single estimate? We noted that there appears to be a ceiling effect in the later ages, and so include variability in production from 12 – 24 months. But this decision is data-dependent and so of course there is a risk of circularity. We point the issue out not to undermine this particular analysis; we believe the ceiling effect is quite clear and other aspects of the age choice do not lead to much change in the CV estimate. Rather we intend to highlight that the summary we give is not a theory-neutral estimate but rather a “best guess” – an attempt to navigate the myriad choices involved in our analysis in a reasonable way. One example of such a choice is that we have made the decision to omit estimates of early production from WG-type forms. Our judgment was motivated by the fact that such estimates routinely are very noisy due to the sparsity of early production. In chapter after chapter, we found unreliable or uninterpretable results that are plausibly due to data sparsity; thus, we choose to omit these patterns. For the sake of our analysis, we have divided measures from the preceding chapters into four categories. These are: Measures of the composition of vocabulary, from Chapters 11 and 12. These measures describe the over- and under-representation of various word categories in vocabulary. The units over which CV is computed are bias scoresl; these are bounded from -.5 to .5 (deviation from unbiased acquisition of a particular category). Predictors of word difficulty, from Chapter 10. The consistency of different regression predictors of age of acquisition are here represented by their cross-linguistic consistency. This analysis is distinct from the analysis presented in that chapter (which focused mostly on the magnitude rather than variability of the coefficients themselves). Despite that, we include it here for comparison with other signatures. The units over which CV is computed are standardized regression coefficients. Relational measures. These measures are from Chapters 7 and 13. These measures are originally correlations between vocabulary size and other aspects of early language. Vocabulary signatures. These measures document patterns in the overall size of vocabulary across individuals and demographic groups. They are extracted from Chapters 5 and 6 and the original units are themselves variability-based (MMAD scores). 15.1.2 Results The figure above shows the coefficient of variation across languages for all measures in each of these categories. Error bars show standard error of the CV. Dot size shows the number of languages included in the analysis. Color shows whether the measure was computed on comprehension or production. Points are ordered from lowest CV to highest. A number of patterns are immediately apparent, providing a synthesis across the different parts of our broader enterprise. First, comprehension is almost always more variable than production, even when an even number of languages are included. The only obvious exception to this regularity is for coefficient weights on arousal in the Predictors category – and we can discount this example: arousal was on average one of the weakest predictors of acquisition order overall. Why would comprehension be more variable across languages than production, especially given evidence that comprehension vocabulary tends to be less idiosyncratic than production (Mayor and Plunkett 2014)? One strong possibility is the psychometric properties of comprehension vs. production reports. As described in Chapter 4, while comprehension scores still appear to be a reliable and valid index of children’s abilities in the aggregate, individual comprehension questions tend to carry less information. Thus, there may simply be more noise in these measurements, leading to less cross-linguistic stability. This regularity illustrates a point we have made earlier and will return to below: the inferences from consistency and variability are asymmetric. In the case of consistency, we can make relatively strong inferences about some kind of shared process or mechanism. In contrast, in the case of variability, there are many sources of variance (including measurement error) that can account for a specific pattern of performance. Second, relational measures are highly invariant across languages. These relations include correlations between the size of children’s lexicon (in production or comprehension) and their gesture, morphology, and grammatical complexity. These findings can be measured in a relatively small set of languages (due to limited data availability for the gesture and complexity items on the form). Nevertheless, the high level of consistency is striking. Of course, as we disussed in the associated chapters, one possible confound in these findings is general parent reporting bias, but – as other evidence militates against this explanation – we are forced towards a view of early language as a highly coherent construct (following e.g., Bornstein and Haynes 1998). Third, demographic predictors – birth order, maternal education, and sex – are somewhat variable, likely reflecting at least some cultural variation. The most variable of these is the relation of maternal education with vocabulary. Maternal education is plausibly a proxy for socioeconomic status (SES); in turn the relation of SES to vocabulary is likely mediated by many local- and national-level policies including access to childcare, parent leave, pre- and post-partum education and services. Thus, we view variation on this dimention as highly plausible a priori. In contrast, as we asserted in Chapter ??, the consistency of children’s variability is quite striking: the variability of children across instruments is almost completely constant, especailly for production. Around the world, toddlers appear to be have similar levels of variability in their level of production. As we explored in Chapter ??, one suggestive explanation of this fimding is that much of this variability is endogenous to the child (or the child-caregiver dyad) rather than being a product of specific variation in the environment. Fourth, generalizations about vocabulary composition span the range from extremely consistent (early over-representation of body parts) to extremely variable (bias for – or against – predicates). Overall, however, it is interesting to see that there are some consistencies in the things that children talk about early: in particular the bias for body parts and animal words seems consistent with some of the results on the predictive power of “babiness” (things babies like to talk about) in Chapter 10. In contrast, it’s the hard and abstract domains that are somewhat more variable, e.g. color, time, logic words (and function words more generally). These analyses are limited by the relatively small set of lexical items that are shared across languages and aross the CDI forms for those languages, however. Finally, while predictors of word difficulty are consistent relative to a chance baseline (see Chapter 10), they are also on the higher end of variability. Especially in comparison to some of the relational signatures (e.g., the correlation between grammatical complexity and vocabulary), their variability is high. Plausibly some of this variability is due to additional variation added to these estimates by the use of external resources (e.g., corpus counts). In particular, as we discussed in that earlier chapter, there is an unknown amount of noise added by estimating frequencies from smaller-scale cross-linguistic corpora. 15.2 Synthesis What is the picture of language development that emerges from the analysis above? In this section we return to the theoretical speculation of Chapter ??. The goal of characterizing areas of consistency in theoretically-relevant signatures of early language was to be able to provide constraints on theory. We turn back to the question of these constraints and how they intersect with existing theories of language development. In Chapter ??, we introduced the idea of “process universals.” These cannot be universals of content as all of the content being reported by parents filling CDI forms is language-specific. Intead, the idea of process universals is that there are processes that operate in different language context to produce the observed pattern of phenomena. These processes could be – but need not be – learner-internal. They could also operate at the level of the child-caregiver dyad, for example. In what follows, we move away from the term “universal.” Although in principle our theoretical goal is process universals, in practice thelimitations of the analysis above are such that we can only speak about “consistent processes.” Not only do we have a maximum of 43 distinct language/instrument samples represented in any estimate, we have a maximum of 29 languages or dialects in any analysis (and often considerably fewer) . This sample, while strong in terms of the within-language estimates, is only a weak start in terms of cross-language estimates (see Piantadosi and Gibson 2014 for guidance on claims about strict universals). Further, there is a strong Indo-European and WEIRD (western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic) bias amongst the languages in the database (Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan 2010). Thus, some consistencies that we observe are probably conditioned on environmental consistencies as well as dyadic and child-internal processes. In the remainder of this chapter, we speculate on some of these. So what sort of developmental process of vocabulary learning could lead to these universals? Any claim of this sort must be very speculative. If pushed, we would point to the following (weak) proposals regarding processes that are consistent with some of our putative universals. Demographic differences are – at least – consistent with interactional-input theories of vocabulary development (Hart and Risley 1995; Hoff 2003; Weisleder and Fernald 2013) in which the more and higher-quality the input the child receives, the faster vocabulary grows. Under this hypothesis, first-born, female, and higher-maternal education children all are likely to receive more and higher-quality input: female children through the route of their somewhat greater social/interactional abilities (an extra assumption), first-born children through their greater allocation of parent attention, and high maternal-education children through greater parental awareness of the role of input, differering parental practices, and greater amount of leisure time to spend with children among other factors. Both the noun bias and the age-of-acquisition prediction results are consistent with the broader cross-situational viewpoint on acquisition (Smith and Yu 2008; Gleitman 1990). On this view, nouns are easy to learn because the more they are heard, the more opportunities children get to build consistent mappings between the words and their referents. In contrast, verbs and other predicates rely more on a base of nouns and a basic comprehension of the syntactic structures in which they appear in order to infer meaning in context. Thus they should be acquired relatively later and with relativel more support from shorter, easier-to-parse utterances (MLU as a predictor, for example). Cross-linguistic exceptions will tend to be for languages like Mandarin where many early-learned verbs are semantically-transparent enough to be learned cross-situationally. Correlations between grammar and the lexicon, as well as the greater role of MLU in predicting acquisition of function words are both consistent with views that posit gradual syntactic abstraction and generalization. Versions of such viewpoints exist throughout the broad theoretical space of language acquisition (Yang 2016; Tomasello 2003; Meylan et al. 2017), but all proposals rely on a learning mechanism in which generalizations about structure are graded and rely on the amount of evidence available.
