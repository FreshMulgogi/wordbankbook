In spite of tremendous individual variation in rate of development (see Chapter 5; Fenson et al. 1994; Hart and Risley 1995), the first words that children utter are reported to be quite consistent (Tardif et al. 2008). In particular, in English, Mandarin, and Cantonese, babies’ first 10 words tended to be about important people in their life (mom, dad), social routines (hi, uh oh), animals (dog, duck), and foods (milk, banana).This chapter attempts to generalize the analysis reported in Tardif, Gelman, and Xu (1999), asking more broadly whether words tend to be learned in the same order across languages. The trouble is that the precise words that children learn in different languages are (of course) language-specific. Thus, we really want to know whether the concepts that are being talked about are the same – or at least similar. As detailed in the Chapter 2, the items on each language’s form are adaptations and not translations: They are intended to capture the spirit of the items on the English form rather to replicate them exactly. So conceptual mappings are approximate, rather than exact. Nonetheless, when these approximate translation equivalents appear on multiple forms we can look at the variability in how quickly they are acquired across languages. Thus, we assume for simplicity that dog, chien, and perro name (roughly) the same concept. To estimate the similarity of each item’s trajectory, we use a single measure of its difficulty: age of acquisition (AoA) – the age at which 50% of children in each language are estimated to have acquired it (Appendix D). We analyzed consistency in both comprehension and production, with production ages of acquisition estimated by stitching across both forms. Consequently, we analyzed only the 29 languages for which data for both forms was available. In total, we estimated ages of acquisition for 945 total words spread across the 29 languages. Unfortunately, not every word appeared on all forms. Figure 8.1 shows the cumulative proportion of forms on which every word appears. For our consistency analysis, we considered only the 335 words that appeared in at least 8 of the 15 languages. Figure 8.1: The proportion of words found on a given number of language’s CDI forms. The dashed line shows the cutoff value we chose. 8.1 The first 10 words Following Tardif et al. (2008), we begin by examining the first 10 words acquired by children across the 15 languages we measured (Tables 8.1 and 8.2). Similar words appeared in the top 10 across languages, especially in children’s first productions. These words consist primarily of important family members (mommy, daddy, grandma), social routines (hi, bye, peekaboo), and sounds (yum yum, vroom, woof woof). Table 8.1: The 10 earliest words that children produce in each language. Table 8.2: The 10 earliest words that children comprehend in each language. Unfortunately, we cannot determine if the greater consistency found in early production is a real regularity about children’s lexical development, or is instead a measurement artifact arising from the greater difficulty of reporting on a child’s comprehension (see Chapter 4). 8.2 Global cross-linguistic similarity Figure 8.2: Correlation between the average age of acquisition in comprehhension and production for each measured word. Despite these differences between comprehension and production, words reported to be acquired early in one are also generally reported to be acquired early in the other. The Figure below shows the relationship between the mean age of acquisition in production and the mean age of acquisition of the each of these 335 words across the 15 languages (Figure 8.2). The correlation between the two measures was quite high: r = 0.8 (p &lt; 0.001). Taken together, these analyses suggest that the rate at which the words on the CDI, and by inference the processes that underpin them, are highly similar across languages. The source of this similarity is hard to pin down. One possibility is that the difficulty of learning a word is determined predominantly by the complexity of the concept denoted by that word, and thus that variability in linguistic and cultural features play a relatively small role in determining the difficulty of learning a word (Gentner and Boroditsky 2001). Alternatively, the primary driver of difficulty could be linguistic, but the dimensions of linguistic variability could be orthogonal to the difficulty of learning. For instance, verbs may be more difficult that nouns because they are relational, and thus that learning nouns makes learning verbs relatively easier than learning verbs makes learning nouns (Gleitman 1990). In this case, the linguistically relevant dimensions would be relatively invariant across languages (Snedeker, Geren, and Shafto 2007). (Finally, because the words on the CDI are not a random sample of words in each language, it could be that generalization from these analyses overestimates the degree of cross-linguistic similarity.) In Chapter 10 we begin to take up these questions using predictive models. Prior to taking this step, however we consider cross-linguistic ordering more holistically. In the remainder of the chapter, we address this problem from two directions: (1) Does similarity in order of acquisition vary with language-to-language similarity, and (2) Does similarity in order of acquisition change over development? 8.3 Acquisition similarity and linguistic similarity Unfortunately, the 15 languages in our analyses are both a small and non-representative sample of the world’s languages, and thus do not have sufficient power to detect typological features of language that might be responsible for differences in the similarity of acquisition across languages. Nonetheless, the languages do come from different languages families, and do vary in their phylogenetic distance. We leverage this variability to ask whether the similarity between two languages is related to similarity in how quickly words for the same concepts are learned in those two languages. Instead of correlating the average similarity of age of acquisition across all languages, we consider the pairwise similarities in the age of acquisition of each of the 335 words in each language. Figure 8.3 shows these pairwise correlations for both comprehension and production as matrices in which each cell shows a single pairwise correlation. These correlation matrices appear to contain a significant amount of structure, with languages that are from the same language family (e.g. Norwegian and Danish) showing higher correlations between the ages of acquisition for the same concepts. Perhaps unsurprisingly from the high average correlation between production and comprehension, pairwise correlations were nearly identical for production and comprehension (r = 0.98, p &lt; 0.001). Figures 8.4 and 8.5 respectively show dendrograms produced by hierarchically clustering these pairwise correlations. Figure 8.3: Correlation matrics showing pairwise correlations in words’ age of acquisition. Languages that are more similar have more similar acquisition orders. Figure 8.4: A hierarchical clustering of the similarity in the ages of words’ first production cross-linguistically. Figure 8.5: A hierarchical clustering of the similarity in the ages of words’ first comprehension cross-linguistically. These dendrograms show high similarity within the North Germanic, Slavic, and Romance language families. Some relationships resist straightforward linguistic explanations (e.g. the relationship of Quebec French to other languages). These may non-uniform sparsity of data across these languages, or may instead reflect interesting cultural or other source of variability. Despite these cases, the structure of ages of acquisition appear to a high degree to reflect the structure of the languages that children learning these words speak. To confirm this observation quantitatively, we borrowed an established measure for measuring linguistic similarity: the lexical similarity of words for the same meaning (S. Wichmann et al. 2010). Using a set of 40 words for meanings common to all of the words languages, E. W. Holman et al. (2008) were able to use a string-edit distance measure recover linguistic similarity measures that correlated highly with geographic distance and also several typological systems. This method is appealing for our purposes as it is relatively agnostic as to the processes of language contact and change that have produced modern-day languages and instead tracks the similarity of wordforms themselves. The language distance measures produced by this method were highly correlated with pairwise correlations in acquisition trajectories for both production (r = -0.44, p &lt; 0.001) and comprehension (r = -0.41, p &lt; 0.001). We also applied this same analysis to the words on the words on the CDI themselves. For each language, we compute the average normalized Levenshtein (1966) distance between the word for each of the 335 common words in our analyses. Levenshtein distance is a measure of the minimum number of insertions, deletions, or substitutions required to transform one string into another. For instance, the distance between the Italian and Norwegian words for dog (cane and hund) is 3. We computed this measure pairwise for all words, and then divided it by the number of characters in the longest word in order to get the edit distance per character (0.75 for cane and hund). This measure was even more correlated with pairwise acquisition trajectories as similarity computed using the 40 words identified by E. W. Holman et al. (2008) for both production (r = -0.57, p &lt; 0.001) and comprehension (r = -0.52, p &lt; 0.001). Because this analysis likely overestimates the dissimilarity of langues written in different scripts–as every word receives a normalized Levenshtein distance of 1 – we replicated this analysis at the phonemic level. We used eSpeak to compute phonetic transcripts of each word and repeated the same analysis on distance between words’ phonetic units in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA; Decker and others 1999). These correlations between IPA distance and pairwise age of acquisition trajectories were again reliable although slightly attenuated for both production (r = -0.29, p = 0.009) and comprehension (r = -0.26, p = 0.020). The robustness of these correlations across a variety of methods suggests that in addition to the high degree of general cross-linguistic similarities in the order of acquisition of words, the dissimilarities between them likely likely reflect reflect differences in the target languages being learned. In our final analysis, we ask whether similarities in ages of acquisition are constant over the course of acquisition, or whether the similarity across languages changes over development. If variability in acquisition trajectories across languages reflects variability in those languages, we might expect that children’s trajectories diverge over the course of language acquisition as the structure of their target language or their cultural milieu play a stronger role in guiding which words are easy or important to learn. Our analyses of the first 10 words above shows striking similarity in the earliest words. Does this similarity decrease for the next 300 words? 8.4 Consistency across development Figure 8.6: Cross-linguistic correlation ages of words’ acquisition over the course of language development. Colored lines show empirical correlations, the gray area shows a 95% confidence interval for a randomly shuffled baseline. Especially in production, cross-linguistic similarity declines over the course of language development. Figure 8.6 shows the broader pattern of cross-linguistic correlations across successively-larger subsets of the vocabulary, as compared to a random baseline. Especially in the domain of production, we see a level of consistency that substantially exceeds baseline. "]
