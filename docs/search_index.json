["appendix-aoa.html", "D Estimating Age of Acquisition", " D Estimating Age of Acquisition It is frequently useful to have an estimate of the age at which children produce a particular word with a probability greater than some threshold; these are commonly referred to as the wordâ€™s age of acquisition (AoA; Goodman, Dale, and Li 2008). In this Appendix, we compare methods for estimating age of acquisition, using the English Words &amp; Sentences data as a case study. The simplest and most obvious measure is to use the empirically-determined first month at which the proportion producing a word exceeds the threshold (we will use 50% of children producing as our threshold in all subsequent discussion, following previous literature (Goodman, Dale, and Li 2008). This approach is simple, but results in the exclusion of a large number of words. Of the total, 11% do not reach this rate by the ceiling of the form and must be discarded. Further, this method is very sensitive to sparse data. A dataset with highly clustered data will show clustered AoAs. For example, in the Swedish data, there are 307 22-month-olds and 0 21-month-olds. Thus, there will be no 21-month AoAs in this dataset. For these reasons, a model-based approach is likely to be more robust. We initially investigated three model-based methods. Each of these models was fit to data from each word (proportion of children producing at each age) individually, resulting in a continuous curve that can be used to predict AoA more precisely. The three models we examined were: Standard generalized linear model, logistic link (GLM) Robust GLM Bayesian GLM with hand-tuned prior parameters (Gelman et al. 2008) For the Bayesian GLM, we experimented substantially with prior setting in order to incorporate information about the slopes and intercepts we expected for words. We used default (Cauchy) priors over coefficients. We used the empirical distribution of GLM slopes to set a strict prior over the age slopes we expected, while setting a much weaker prior over intercepts. In practice, in larger datasets, only the most extreme words (e.g. mommy, for which there is a ceiling effect for nearly every age) are affected by this choice. In addition to these models, we investigated a hierarchical Bayesian model with shared distributional components across words. This model appeared to perform similarly to the simple word-based Bayesian model (at least in the presence of sufficient data) and was relatively expensive to fit in terms of computation, so we do not discuss it here. Figure D.1 shows the results of these simulations, in the form of histograms of recovered 50% AoA values. The empirical AoAs are clearly clumpy in precisely the way we describe above, even with a substantial amount of data in the analysis (N = 5520). In contrast, all three models smooth the distribution substantially, which is likely beneficial to downstream analyses. Although there are some subtle differences in the shape of the main distribution between models, the main action is found on the tails. The different models treat floor and ceiling items differently. Both the GLM and robust GLM recover two AoAs below zero (mommy and daddy); the priors of the Bayesian GLM regularize these AoAs to be 8 and 9 months respectively. Further, the Bayesian GLM estimates 10% of AoAs above 30 months (the max value in the data), while the other two methods estimate slightly fewer: 8% and 7% respectively. These Bayesian GLM results strike us as a priori more reasonable than those returned by the other methods (although they only affect a small minority of words). Figure D.1: Histogram of English (American) age of acquisition values as estimated via a variety of statistical methods (panels). To further test the Bayesian GLM approach, we tested the accuracy of the method in recovering AoAs for much smaller datasets. We did this by taking a subsample of only 100 children from the full English (American) WS dataset. We then fit standard and Bayesian GLMs to this sparse subsample. The resulting AoA estimates are plotted in Figure D.2. The Bayesian GLM shows the same minor bias to lower AoAs for hard words that the regular GLM does (a slightly below-diagonal slope), but the GLM shows much noisier estimates for the top and bottom words, suggesting that the regularization from the prior values in the Bayesian model is allowing it to deal with sparse data more effectively.

Differences of AoA &gt; 4 months between methods are labeled. In sum, our analyses suggest that some sort of Bayesian approach is useful for estimating AoA values. "]
