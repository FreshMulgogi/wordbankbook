<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Theoretical Foundations</h1>
<p>The ability to use language in its lexical and combinatorial richness – with hundreds of thousands of words, and an infinity of possible meanings – is uniquely human. In The study of language acquisition has been a traditional locus of our search to understand the nature of this ability. As such, the nature of the abilities that allow human children to acquire a language is one of the historical “great debates,” in which different proposals about the architecture of the human mind and the nature of human uniqueness have been proposed. Does language arise from domain-specific adaptations for syntactic structure <span class="citation">(N. Chomsky <a href="references.html#ref-chomsky1981">1981</a>; N. Chomsky <a href="references.html#ref-chomsky2014">2014</a>)</span>? Or does it arise from a combination of environmental input and sophisticated, general-purpose learning mechanisms <span class="citation">(Elman et al. <a href="references.html#ref-elman1996">1996</a>)</span>? Two poles have traditionally emerged in this discussion (Figure <a href="#fig:poles"><strong>??</strong></a> ): from domain-general empiricist proposals to domain-specific, nativist proposals.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we begin by presenting the perspective from these poles but argue that they are rarely helpful in the practice of understanding the scope and course of early language learning. Instead, we argue for the development of theories that describe the scope and course of language learning as a whole, as well as its quantative variation across children, langugaes, and cultures. These concerns lead us to develop a theoretical vocabulary that focuses on consistency and variability; connections across timescales of learning’ and the notion of process, rather than content, universals. We end by discussing the role of replication and larger datasets in building quantitative theories.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> The Picture To Date</h2>
<p><img src="images/axis.jpeg" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Empiricist proposals emphasize the ability of children to learn structure across domains, the richness of the distributional input that children are exposed to, and their ability to create appropriate abstractions from structured linguistic input. The components of these proposals are children’s general statistical learning abilities <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="saffran1996"><strong>???</strong></span>; <span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="aslin2002"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>, When applied to linguistic input, even general statistical tools can recover some aspects of structure <span class="citation">(Redington, Crater, and Finch <a href="references.html#ref-redington1998">1998</a>,<span class="citation">S. L. Frank, Bod, and Christiansen (<a href="references.html#ref-frank2012">2012</a>)</span>)</span>. Such proposals have as their primary challenge the ability of children to create fast abstractions early in childhood that allow them to create systematic word orders even in the absence of input <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="goldin-meadow1981"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>, interpret the arguments of novel verbs <span class="citation">(Y. Gertner, Fisher, and Eisengart <a href="references.html#ref-gertner2006">2006</a>)</span>, and evidence of abstract category structure for syntactic elements like determiners <span class="citation">(Charles Yang <a href="references.html#ref-yang2013">2013</a>)</span> or for structures like the dative <span class="citation">(Conwell and Demuth <a href="references.html#ref-conwell2007">2007</a>)</span> even at a very young age.</p>
<p>Nativist proposals in contrast tend to focus on the complexity of the grammatical structures that even young children appear to possess, relative to their rarity in children’s environment. Such arguments emphasize the poverty of the linguistic stimulus <span class="citation">(e.g., Legate and Yang <a href="references.html#ref-legate2002">2002</a>)</span>, relative to the richness of the structual generalizations children make <span class="citation">(e.g., Crain and Thornton <a href="references.html#ref-crain2000">2000</a>)</span>. The type of proposals that are on offer within this space include “principles and parameters” theories, in which languages share a set of syntactic principles that govern syntactic combination but vary on a relatively small set of parameters that control how these structures are combined <span class="citation">(Baker <a href="references.html#ref-baker2005">2005</a>,<span class="citation">Yang (<a href="references.html#ref-yang2002">2002</a>)</span>)</span>. But these proposals are challenged by the vast cross-linguistic differences in syntactic abstractions <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="evans2009"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>, by the character and scope of children’s syntactic generalizations <span class="citation">(which are often tied to specific lexical structures; <span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="tomasello000"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>, and by evidence of early input-sensitive learning and generalization both within specific domains <span class="citation">(e.g., Meylan et al. <a href="references.html#ref-meylan2017">2017</a>)</span> and in artificial language tasks <span class="citation">(Gómez and Gerken <a href="references.html#ref-gomez1999">1999</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This “great debate” is philosophically appealing, but has also led to a polarization of the field of language acquisition. Typically researchers work in their own siloed traditions (empiricist or nativist), working on individual phenomena that do not make contact with one another – a classic version of <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="kuhn1964"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>’s “paradigms.” Research in the nativist tradition often focuses on particular syntactic phenomena that are largely neglected in the empiricist tradition <span class="citation">(e.g., the “optional infinitive,” Wexler <a href="references.html#ref-wexler1998">1998</a>; but cf. Freudenthal, Pine, and Gobet <a href="references.html#ref-freudenthal2010">2010</a>)</span>. In contrast, research in the empiricist tradition has often used artificial language learning tasks that are argued not to reflect on the underlying structural properties that are claimed to be innate <span class="citation">(e.g., Lany and Saffran <a href="references.html#ref-lany2010">2010</a>; cf. C.D. Yang <a href="references.html#ref-yang2004">2004</a>)</span>. By focusing on different paradigms and phenomena and theorizing using distinct vocabularies, these traditions make less and less contact.</p>
<p>In addition, these theories are frameworks, rather than than actual hypotheses: Few proposals can be said to generate testable and clearly competing predictions, even within a specific domain. Any individual observation cannot be said to be inconsistent with any but the absolute strongest nativist or empiricist position. To be tested, they must be instantiated in specific computational mechanisms. Computational models are an important proving grouping, but in practice they end up less differentiated than rhetoric suggests. In order to get off the ground in performing a particular empirical task, theories must often help themselves to generous amounts of both innate structure – in the form of structured inputs from social, cognitive, or perceptual domains – and statistical learning <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="roy2003"><strong>???</strong></span>; Alishahi and Stevenson <a href="references.html#ref-alishahi2008">2008</a>; M. C. Frank, Goodman, and Tenenbaum <a href="references.html#ref-frank2009">2009</a>; M. C. Frank et al. <a href="references.html#ref-frank2010">2010</a>; C.D. Yang <a href="references.html#ref-yang2004">2004</a>)</span>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Further, when these viewpoints come together, they are often instantiated in debates over phenomena that – from a bird’s eye view – are trivial in the general course of language development. Abstraction debates have played out in the acquisition of the definite determiner “the” <span class="citation">(Valian <a href="references.html#ref-valian1986">1986</a>; J. M. Pine and Lieven <a href="references.html#ref-pine1997">1997</a>; Charles Yang <a href="references.html#ref-yang2013">2013</a>; Meylan et al. <a href="references.html#ref-meylan2017">2017</a>)</span>, auxilliary inversion <span class="citation">(Pullum and Scholz <a href="references.html#ref-pullum2002">2002</a>; Legate and Yang <a href="references.html#ref-legate2002">2002</a>)</span>, the use of anaphoric “one” <span class="citation">(Akhtar et al. <a href="references.html#ref-akhtar2004">2004</a>, ’ @regier2004; Lidz, Waxman, and Freedman <a href="references.html#ref-lidz2003">2003</a>)</span>, for example. All of these phenomena concern syntactic abstractions, reflecting a broader historical argument that syntactic structure is the heart of the uniquely human language faculty <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="chomky1967"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>, and other aspects of language tend to be shared with other species <span class="citation">(Hauser, Chomsky, and Fitch <a href="references.html#ref-hauser2002">2002</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>But syntax is far from the only unique or notable feature of human communication, from an evolutionary perspective <span class="citation">(e.g., Steven Pinker and Jackendoff <a href="references.html#ref-pinker2005">2005</a>; Tomasello <a href="references.html#ref-tomasello2010">2010</a>)</span>. The nature and range of communciative gestures, the variety of sounds, and the diversity of lexical items all are relatively unprecedented – especially in the primate lineage. And these observable aspects of language – as well as the emergence of syntactic structure more broadly – are some of what makes the broad course of language acquisition striking from the perspective of a clinician or a parent. We notice the first communicative signals, the emergence and rapid growth of of vocabulary, the beginning of the productive combination of words, increases in the length and complexity of utterances, and the patterns of error and overgeneralization that remain in early childhood.</p>
<p>These broader patterns of language learning are the natural focus of investigations like ours that use parent report to learn about children’s language. While parents are attentive and accurate observers of communicative gesture, vocabulary, and word combination, without linguistic training they may not even notice subtleties like non-productive determine use, auxilliary inversion, or anaphoric “one.” Further, these investigations can in many case make productive contact with the rich literatures on early communication, speech perception <span class="citation">(e.g., Kuhl <a href="references.html#ref-kuhl2004">2004</a>)</span>, word learning <span class="citation">(e.g., Bloom <a href="references.html#ref-bloom2002">2002</a>; Snedeker <a href="references.html#ref-snedeker2009">2009</a>)</span>, and grammatical productivity through verb structure <span class="citation">(C. Fisher et al. <a href="references.html#ref-fisher2010">2010</a>)</span>. While debates over the nature of syntactic knowledge and abstraction have raged, other subfields of language acquisition have prospered.</p>
<p>Research in these subfields makes at most limited contact with broad questions of nativism and empiricism, in part because they deal with phenomena that are language specific – sounds, lexical items, grammatical constructions – and hence that children <em>must</em> learn from their input. The question is then about the mechanisms and constraints that guide this process of learning , rather than about any posited universal or innate content (even at the level of abstractions).</p>
<p>So what should a unifying theoretical framework for language learning look like? Despite our critiques above, we still believe in the importance of the search for core, universal aspects of language learning that elucidate the process by which children acquire this uniquely human ability. Yet we believe that the sort of theory that describes such universals will likely look radically different from its historical antecedents. Below and in the remainder of this chapter, we sketch some aspects of what such a theory will look like and how this vision connects to the remainder of our manuscript.</p>
<p>First, any universal is likely to be a statistical or quantitative universal – we refer to these as “consistencies.” The variation across the world’s languages is such that only the most tautological facts will be truly invariant <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="evans2009"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>. Further, we are unlikely to be able to access the kinds of samples that would allow us to make claims of universality <span class="citation">(Piantadosi and Gibson <a href="references.html#ref-piantadosi2014">2014</a>)</span>. Thus, we should talk about relative consistency and variability of particular phenomena rather than any sorts of absolutes.</p>
<p>Second, language learning takes place at the timescale of years. CDI forms provide a global snapshot of a child’s language at a particular point in time, rather than demonstrating the operation of a particular mechanism or principle. Substantial reconstruction is necessary to understand how processes operating over seconds – for example, online statistical learning or pragmatic inference – would result in particular structures accreting over time in the vocabulary. Thus, consistencies we observe are at best the basis for abductive inferences about underlying mechanisms.</p>
<p>Third, the regularities we observe are in the learning of vocabulary and constructions, rather than syntactic rules. These items <em>must</em> be learned from data. Thus any putative universals identified in our investigation must not be “content universals” that specific particular grammatical rules or linkages. They must be “process universals” in the sense that they specify mechanisms or processes that unfold over time and operate over children’s interactional input in ways that produce the observed consistencies.</p>
<p>Finally, the project of this books is fundamentally about empirical unification of phenomena. By replication of analyses across different datasets, we provide a testbed for theoretical ideas that make contact with data. We believe our work here embodies the transformational potential of data. Data can provide precision in measurement, though – as we are at pains to point out throughout – doing so requires constant attention to sources of bias.</p>

<div id="variability-and-consistency" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Variability and Consistency</h2>
<p>As we noted in the introduction, observing what “hangs together” in development can provide clues to the underlying system <span class="citation">(Bates, Bretherton, and Snyder <a href="references.html#ref-bates1988">1988</a>)</span>. We think of these correlations as loose targets for theorists: a successful theory can gain support by providing an account for these observations. Crudely put, if a theory posits that some aspect of language acquisition is universal, it should be relatively more consistent in our data.</p>
<p>What are the units over which we compute variability and consistency? We refer to these as “signatures” – loosely, things that can vary across populations. In practice, a signature can be the output of any analysis, with the simplest being vocabulary size or variability itself (as in Chapter <a href="vocab.html#vocab">4</a>). Signatures are linked to particular theoretical goals by arguments about the validity of an analysis – for example, the argument of <span class="citation">Bates et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-bates1994">1994</a>)</span> that the over-representation of nouns in early vocabulary is a meaningful dimension of variation between individuals. A signature for our purposes is thus an analysis that yields a set of numbers. In nearly every substantive chapter of the book, we define one or several signatures whose variability we can measure.</p>
<p>Different sources of variance provide different sorts of evidence. Variance across cultures and languages can provide evidence on what patterns of acquis</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Timescales and Mechanisms</h2>
<p>Back to the slobin/competition model argument.</p>
<p>Are some languages harder to learn than others. At some level yes, Danish is really hard <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="bleses"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span></p>
<p>We’re not trying to argue against the data on spanish clitics or agglutinatives in russian.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the general developmental course is consistent. And degree of variation.</p>
<p>The universal is in the general aspects, not the details.</p>
</div>
<div id="process-universals" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Process Universals</h2>
<p>What is the nature of these putatitive universals? By virtue of the learning problem that they arise from, they cannot be universals of <em>content</em>. A child’s vocabulary is made up of individual words, each arising from a set of specific interactional circumstances (e.g., the trip to the zoo where a giraffe was seen for the first time). And each of these words is – of course – specific to a particular language. Thus, there is no viable sense in which any possible universals for vocabulary learning can be content universals: no particular content of this type could be innately given. For this reason, we describe these as “process” universals: they relate to the process by which each individual extracts a lexicon from their own idiosyncratic linguistic experiences.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>IT’S ABOUT LEARNING - UPTAKE OF INPUT</p></li>
<li><p>COGNITIVE COMPONENTS, PROCESSING SPEED, ATTENTION, GENERALIZATION, LEARNING</p></li>
<li><p>UNFOLDING OVER TIME - IT’S FUNDAMENTALLY DEVELOPMENTAL, ABOUT THE WAY THAT KNOWLEDGE ACCUMULATES</p></li>
<li><p>IN THE CONTEXT OF CHIlD AND ENVIRONMENT</p></li>
<li><p>BRONFENBRENNER-ESQ</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To examine whether there is content to the claim of process universals, it is helpful to consider the alternative hypothesis. One alternative is that the process of language acquisition is specific and particular, rather than universal. Two prominent particulars pull against universal tendencies.</p>
<p>The first is the vast semantic and syntactic variation across the world’s languages. For example, as illustrated by <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="slobin1996"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> and others, languages vary dramatically in the ways that they assign semantic content to verbs. If the semantic partition of verbs led to large-scale differences in the timeline or mechanism of acquisition, we might see systematic differences in the predictors of age of acquisition for verbs in these languages, yet we do not. Further, languages are more and less morphologically complex; while the most morphologically-complex, polysynthetic languages are not represented in Wordbank, we do have data from both Mandarin (less complex) and Russian (more complex). If morphosyntax were relatively more or less important in the acquisition of particular languages, we might expect radical differences in the noun bias, the grammar-lexicon correlation, or the predictors of age of acquisition across languages, yet we do not observe these. Of course, there is always room for finer-grained predictions – with more detailed predictive models and better typological coverage, perhaps we will discover such signatures. Our point here is merely that neither morphosyntactic nor semantic variability across languages dominates the process of vocabulary acquisition.</p>
<p>The second set of language-specific particulars that might lead to variance across languages is the vast cultural variability across the communities represented in the Wordbank data. With N continents represented, we see both “individualist” and “collectivist” cultures <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="markus1991"><strong>???</strong></span>,<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="nisbett"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>)</span> as well as both “loose fit” and “tight fit” cultures <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="gelfand2011"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>. To the extent that parenting differs across these – and there is good evidence that it does [CITES] – we should see variance in the trajectory of language learning. For example, as mentioned previously, it would be quite reasonable to predict that the female advantage in vocabulary acquisition might vary as a function of cross-national gender biases <span class="citation">(Nosek et al. <a href="references.html#ref-nosek2009">2009</a>)</span>. Yet it is strikingly consistent overall, again arguing that – at the broadest level, at least – cultural factors do not dominate other child-internal processes in the acquisition of vocabulary.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Replication and Theory-Building</h2>
<p>One view of our enterprise is that its impact is fundamentally in the consolidation of knowledge through unifying – replicating – previous work. Crudely put, we have compiled all of the CDI data that we could, and all of the CDI analyses, and executed the cross of analyses and datasets. This project is thus a cross-linguistic replication study.</p>
