<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 1</span> Theoretical Foundations</h1>
<p>One of the defining human characteristics is the ability to use language in its lexical and combinatorial richness. The study of language acquisition has been a traditional locus of our search to understand the nature of this ability. What allows human children to acquire a language has been the subject of one of the historical “great debates,” in which highly diverse proposals about the architecture of the human mind and the nature of human uniqueness have been formulated. Does language arise from domain-specific adaptations for syntactic structure <span class="citation">(Chomsky <a href="references.html#ref-chomsky1981">1981</a>, <a href="references.html#ref-chomsky2014">2014</a>)</span>? Or does it arise from a combination of environmental input and sophisticated, general-purpose learning mechanisms <span class="citation">(Elman et al. <a href="references.html#ref-elman1996">1996</a>)</span>? Two poles have traditionally emerged in this discussion: from domain-general empiricist proposals to domain-specific nativist proposals, as illustrated in Figure <a href="intro-theory.html#fig:theory-axis">1.1</a>.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>In this chapter, we begin by presenting the perspective from these poles but contend that they are rarely helpful in the practice of understanding the scope and course of early language learning. Instead, we argue for the development of theories that describe the scope and course of language learning as a whole, as well as its quantitative variation across children, languages, and cultures. These concerns lead us to frame our own study in terms of a set of distinct theoretical issues: capturing consistency and variability; drawing connections across timescales of learning; and the notion of process, rather than content, universals. We end by discussing the relation of our theoretical stance to others and the role of replication and larger datasets in building quantitative theories.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> The picture to date</h2>
<p>Nativist proposals regarding language acquisition have typically been tightly focused on syntactic development, assuming that children’ phonology, morphology, and lexicon are learned from their input. Within the domain of syntax, the emphasis is on the complexity of the grammatical structures that young children appear to possess <span class="citation">(e.g., Crain and Thornton <a href="references.html#ref-crain2000">2000</a>)</span>. To the extent that these are rare in children’s environment, this rarity could suggest an innate foundation for children’s knowledge <span class="citation">(e.g., Legate and Yang <a href="references.html#ref-legate2002">2002</a>)</span>. The type of proposals that are on offer within this space often include “principles and parameters”-type theories, in which languages share a set of syntactic principles that govern syntactic combination but vary on a relatively small set of parameters that control how these structures vary <span class="citation">(Baker <a href="references.html#ref-baker2005">2005</a>; Yang <a href="references.html#ref-yang2002">2002</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>These proposals are challenged by the vast cross-linguistic differences in syntactic abstractions <span class="citation">(Evans and Levinson <a href="references.html#ref-evans2009">2009</a>)</span>, by the character and scope of children’s syntactic generalizations <span class="citation">(which are often tied to specific lexical structures; Tomasello <a href="references.html#ref-tomasello2000">2000</a>)</span>, and by evidence of early input-sensitive learning and generalization both within specific domains <span class="citation">(e.g., Meylan et al. <a href="references.html#ref-meylan2017">2017</a>)</span> and in artificial language tasks <span class="citation">(Gómez and Gerken <a href="references.html#ref-gomez1999">1999</a>)</span>. Such proposals also tend to downplay the inherent variability that characterizes language learning across individuals <span class="citation">(Bates, Bretherton, and Snyder <a href="references.html#ref-bates1988">1988</a>; Bates et al. <a href="references.html#ref-bates1994">1994</a>)</span>, focusing instead on the universals or commonalities that exist across children. While nativist proposals acknowledge that individual variation exists, variation is thought to serve a primarily descriptive function, existing in a “theoretical vacuum” <span class="citation">(Bloom <a href="references.html#ref-bloom2002">2002</a>, 52)</span>, with greater emphasis on how language acquisition works in the general case.</p>
<p>In contrast, empiricist proposals for language learning emphasize the ability of children to learn structure across domains, the richness of the distributional input that children are exposed to, and their ability to create appropriate abstractions from structured linguistic input. One important component of these proposals is children’s general statistical learning abilities <span class="citation">(Saffran, Aslin, and Newport <a href="references.html#ref-saffran1996">1996</a>; Fiser and Aslin <a href="references.html#ref-fiser2002">2002</a>)</span>. When applied to linguistic input, even general statistical tools can recover some aspects of linguistic structure across a variety of domains <span class="citation">(Redington, Crater, and Finch <a href="references.html#ref-redington1998">1998</a>; Frank, Bod, and Christiansen <a href="references.html#ref-frank2012">2012</a>; Elman et al. <a href="references.html#ref-elman1996">1996</a>)</span>. Further, statistical learning abilities are likely useful for learning sound structures <span class="citation">(Feldman, Griffiths, and Morgan <a href="references.html#ref-feldman2009">2009</a>)</span> and vocabulary <span class="citation">(Smith and Yu <a href="references.html#ref-smith2008">2008</a>)</span>. Thus, one strength of more empiricist proposals is their ability to deal with a broad set of acquisition phenomena.</p>
<p>Empiricist proposals regarding linguistic structure are sometimes referred to as “emergentist” or “constructivist” accounts. Such accunts have as a primary challenge that children show evidence of abstractions that encode key aspects of linguistic competence, even at an early age and in the absence of substantial input. For example, young children show some evidence of systematicity in the word order of their productions, even in the absence of structured input <span class="citation">(Goldin-Meadow and Mylander <a href="references.html#ref-goldin-meadow1983">1983</a>; cf. Bowerman <a href="references.html#ref-bowerman1973">1973</a>)</span>. Further, at least by some time in their third year, typically developing children appear interpret the arguments of novel verbs <span class="citation">(Gertner, Fisher, and Eisengart <a href="references.html#ref-gertner2006">2006</a>)</span> and show evidence of category structure for syntactic categories such as determiners <span class="citation">(Yang <a href="references.html#ref-yang2013">2013</a>)</span> and structures such as the dative <span class="citation">(Conwell and Demuth <a href="references.html#ref-conwell2007">2007</a>)</span>. These results are sometimes intepreted as suggesting that while general learning mechanisms are necessary for language acquisition, they are not sufficient – especially in the domain of syntactic structure.</p>
<p>The “great debate” between these viewpoints is philosophically appealing, but has also led to a polarization of the field of language acquisition. Typically researchers work in their own siloed traditions (empiricist or nativist), and focus on individual phenomena that do not make contact with one another – a classic version of <span class="citation">Kuhn (<a href="references.html#ref-kuhn1970">1970</a>)</span>’s “paradigms.” Research in the nativist tradition often focuses on particular syntactic phenomena that are largely neglected in the empiricist tradition <span class="citation">(e.g., the “optional infinitive,” Wexler <a href="references.html#ref-wexler1998">1998</a>; but cf. Freudenthal, Pine, and Gobet <a href="references.html#ref-freudenthal2010">2010</a>)</span>. In contrast, research in the empiricist tradition has often used artificial language learning tasks that are argued not to reflect the underlying structural properties that are claimed to be innate <span class="citation">(e.g., Lany and Saffran <a href="references.html#ref-lany2010">2010</a>; cf. Yang <a href="references.html#ref-yang2004">2004</a>)</span>. Empiricist theories are also more likely to recognize the causes and consequences of individual variation in rates of learning, including potential sources of that variation that arise from variation in the circumstances in which children learn and the opportunities they have for engaging with language in a meaningful way (e.g., <span class="citation">Huttenlocher et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-huttenlocher1991">1991</a>)</span>; <span class="citation">Hoff (<a href="references.html#ref-hoff2006">2006</a>)</span>; <span class="citation">Weisleder and Fernald (<a href="references.html#ref-weisleder2013">2013</a>)</span>). By focusing on different paradigms and phenomena and theorizing using distinct vocabularies, these traditions make limited contact. Often, language development conferences feature paired keynote talks from these two different traditions – a clear sign of polarization.</p>
<p>In addition, these theories are frameworks, rather than actual hypotheses. Few proposals within these frameworks can be said to generate testable and clearly competing predictions, even within a specific domain. And, any individual observation typically cannot be said to be inconsistent with any but the absolute strongest nativist or empiricist position. To be tested, proposals must make specific predictions. Computational models have been an important method for allowing proposals to be instantiated to the degree that they can make testable predictions. In practice, however models typically end up less differentiated than framework rhetoric suggests. In order to get off the ground in performing a particular empirical task, theories must often help themselves to generous amounts of both innate structure – in the form of structured inputs from social, cognitive, or perceptual domains – and statistical learning abilities <span class="citation">(Roy and Pentland <a href="references.html#ref-roy2002">2002</a>; Alishahi and Stevenson <a href="references.html#ref-alishahi2008">2008</a>; Frank, Goodman, and Tenenbaum <a href="references.html#ref-frank2009">2009</a>; Frank et al. <a href="references.html#ref-frank2010">2010</a>; Yang <a href="references.html#ref-yang2004">2004</a>)</span>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Further, when nativist and empiricist viewpoints do make differing predictions, they are often in phenomena that – from a bird’s eye, or even parents’ eye, view – are relatively trivial in the general course of language development. This observation is especially true in the domain of syntax! Abstraction debates have played out in the acquisition of the definite determiner “the” <span class="citation">(Valian <a href="references.html#ref-valian1986">1986</a>; Pine and Lieven <a href="references.html#ref-pine1997">1997</a>; Yang <a href="references.html#ref-yang2013">2013</a>; Meylan et al. <a href="references.html#ref-meylan2017">2017</a>)</span>, auxiliary inversion <span class="citation">(Pullum and Scholz <a href="references.html#ref-pullum2002">2002</a>; Legate and Yang <a href="references.html#ref-legate2002">2002</a>)</span>, and the use of anaphoric “one” <span class="citation">(Akhtar et al. <a href="references.html#ref-akhtar2004">2004</a>; Regier and Gahl <a href="references.html#ref-regier2004">2004</a>; Lidz, Waxman, and Freedman <a href="references.html#ref-lidz2003">2003</a>)</span>, for example. These highly-specific and complex phenomena are occasionally observable in the children of linguistically-trained parents, but even the closest observer would be forgiven for being more compelled by watching the increasingly creative and complex ways that children interpret, use, and play with language, rather than the occasional syntactic slip. Further, all of these phenomena reflect a broader historical argument that syntactic structure is the heart of the uniquely human language faculty <span class="citation">(Chomsky <a href="references.html#ref-chomsky1957">1957</a>)</span>, and that other aspects of language tend to be shared with other species <span class="citation">(Hauser, Chomsky, and Fitch <a href="references.html#ref-hauser2002">2002</a>)</span> and are therefore somehow less interesting and less critical as objects of study.</p>
<p>From an evolutionary perspective, syntax is far from the only unique or notable feature of human communication, however <span class="citation">(Pinker and Jackendoff <a href="references.html#ref-pinker2005">2005</a>; Tomasello <a href="references.html#ref-tomasello2010">2010</a>)</span>. The nature and range of communicative gestures, the variety of sounds, and the diversity of lexical items all are relatively unprecedented – especially in the primate lineage. And these observable aspects of language – as well as the emergence of syntactic structure more broadly – are some of what makes the broad course of language acquisition striking from the perspective of a clinician or a parent. We notice the first communicative signals, the emergence and rapid growth of vocabulary, the beginning of the productive combination of words, increases in the length and complexity of utterances, and the patterns of error and overgeneralization that remain in early childhood. Moreover, there is considerable evidence for continuity across these domains <span class="citation">(e.g., Bornstein and Putnick <a href="references.html#ref-bornstein2012">2012</a>; Tsao, Liu, and Kuhl <a href="references.html#ref-tsao2004">2004</a>; Bates, Bretherton, and Snyder <a href="references.html#ref-bates1988">1988</a>; Cristia et al. <a href="references.html#ref-cristia2014">2014</a>)</span>. Children’s earliest gestures and sounds relate to their oral language comprehension and production. And, these in turn relate to later skill in using language as a tool for learning, through both auditory (or visual, in the case of sign language) and written modalities.</p>
<p>These broader patterns of language learning are the natural focus of investigations like ours that use parent report to learn about children’s language. Parents are attentive and accurate observers of communicative gesture, vocabulary, and word combination. But without linguistic training they may not even notice subtleties like non-productive determiner use, auxiliary inversion, or anaphoric “one.” Further, these investigations can, in many cases, make productive contact with the rich literatures on early communication, speech perception <span class="citation">(e.g., Kuhl <a href="references.html#ref-kuhl2004">2004</a>)</span>, word learning <span class="citation">(e.g., Bloom <a href="references.html#ref-bloom2002">2002</a>; Snedeker <a href="references.html#ref-snedeker2009">2009</a>)</span>, and grammatical productivity through verb structure <span class="citation">(Fisher et al. <a href="references.html#ref-fisher2010">2010</a>)</span>. While debates over the nature of syntactic knowledge and abstraction have raged, other subfields of language acquisition have prospered.
Research in these subfields makes at most limited contact with broad questions of nativism and empiricism, in part because they deal with phenomena that are language specific – sounds, lexical items, grammatical constructions – and hence that children <em>must</em> learn from their input. The question is then about the mechanisms and constraints that guide this process of learning, rather than about any posited universal or innate content (even at the level of abstractions).</p>
</div>
<div id="making-progress" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Making progress</h2>
<p>To move beyond great debates, what should a unifying theoretical framework for language learning look like? In spite of the critiques above, we still believe in the importance of the search for core, universal aspects of language learning that elucidate the process by which children acquire this uniquely human ability. Yet the sort of theory that describes such universals will likely look radically different from its historical antecedents. Below and in the remainder of this chapter, we sketch some aspects of what such a theory will look like and how this vision connects to our present investigation.</p>
<p>Any universal is likely to be a statistical or quantitative universal – we refer to these as “consistencies.” The variation across the world’s languages is such that very few properties will be truly invariant <span class="citation">(Evans and Levinson <a href="references.html#ref-evans2009">2009</a>)</span>. Further, we are unlikely to be able to access the kinds of samples that would allow us to make claims of universality <span class="citation">(one estimate suggests that claims of universality require more than 100 languages from diverse families; Piantadosi and Gibson <a href="references.html#ref-piantadosi2014">2014</a>)</span>. Thus, we should talk about the relative consistency and variability of particular phenomena rather than any sorts of absolutes.</p>
<p>In addition, language learning takes place at the timescale of years. A parent’s responses on a CDI form provide a global snapshot of a child’s language at a particular point in time, rather than demonstrating the operation of a particular mechanism or principle. Substantial reconstruction is necessary to understand how processes operating over seconds – for example, online statistical learning or pragmatic inference – would result in particular structures accreting over time in the vocabulary. Thus, consistencies we observe are at best the basis for abductive inferences about underlying mechanisms.</p>
<p>These consistencies are consistencies in the learning of vocabulary and constructions, rather than syntactic rules. Words and constructions <em>must</em> be learned from data. Thus any putative universals identified in our investigation must not be “content universals” that specific particular grammatical rules or linkages. They must be “process universals” in the sense that they specify mechanisms or processes that unfold over time and operate over children’s interactional input in ways that produce the observed consistencies.</p>
<p>Before we begin spelling out these ideas in more depth, we note that there are several important precedents for this line of argument. First, harkening back to <span class="citation">Bates, Bretherton, and Snyder (<a href="references.html#ref-bates1988">1988</a>)</span> and <span class="citation">Elman et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-elman1996">1996</a>)</span>, our proposal is a shift from a focus on consistencies in representational content to a focus on consistent learning mechanisms.
Second, <span class="citation">Clark (<a href="references.html#ref-clark1977">1977</a>)</span> distinguish between “process” and “product.” In the language of this distinction, our work in this book aims at uncovering <em>processes</em> that lead to the <em>products</em> that parents observe and report on the CDI. Finally, these “process universals” are likely to be similar to the “operating principles” discussed by Slobin <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-slobin1973">1973</a>, <a href="references.html#ref-slobin1985">1985</a>)</span>, although Slobin’s initial idea was that these would be elements of the Chomskian Language Acquisition Device, and hence likely language-specific. As we will see below and throughout our narrative, many apparent process universals seem to be driven by non-linguistic factors like children’s general statistical learning abilities as well as the ways they allocate their attention to the world around them.</p>
</div>
<div id="variability-and-consistency" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Variability and consistency</h2>
<p>Observing what “hangs together” in development can provide clues about the architecture of the underlying system <span class="citation">(Bates, Bretherton, and Snyder <a href="references.html#ref-bates1988">1988</a>)</span>. We think of these correlations as loose targets for theorists: a successful theory can gain support by providing an account for these observations. Crudely put, if a theory posits that some aspect of language acquisition is universal, it should be relatively more consistent in our data.</p>
<p>What are the units over which we compute variability and consistency? We refer to these as “signatures” – loosely, measurements that can vary across populations. In practice, a signature can be the output of any analysis, with the simplest being vocabulary size or variability itself (as in Chapter <a href="vocabulary.html#vocabulary">5</a>). Signatures are linked to particular theoretical goals by arguments about the validity of an analysis – for example, the argument of <span class="citation">Bates et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-bates1994">1994</a>)</span> that the over-representation of nouns in early vocabulary is a meaningful dimension of variation between individuals. A signature for our purposes is thus an analysis that yields a set of numbers. In nearly every chapter of the book, we define one or several signatures whose variability we can measure.</p>
<p>Different sources of variability provide different sorts of evidence. One sense of the notion of “universal” that dates to early generative syntax is the notion of typological invariance – invariance across languages <span class="citation">(Greenberg <a href="references.html#ref-greenberg1963">1963</a>)</span>. Following this general idea, in the majority of the book we focus on variability in some signature across languages. The implied inference is that consistency across languages points to the idea that a signature results from some mechanism (more on inferences about mechanism below) that is independent of the language being learned and the context in which it is learned.</p>
<p>But when we assess the variability of some signature across datasets, many things vary that are not the target of our inference. Although language and culture typically vary (except in the case of multiple instruments that are assessed on the same data source), many other things vary as well. Different datasets are constructed by different researchers with different goals. They use different instruments with different items – and different length and composition. These instruments are administered to different samples, with different sampling strategies. And the nature of the administration is different as well.</p>
<p>Thus, when a particular response appears to be consistent, we can say <em>a fortiori</em> that none of these sources of variation appear to have affected the consistency of the response. (Or at least that if they have, they have canceled each other out in a highly non-random way). But when variability does occur, we cannot make the opposite inference. Variability has many explanations, but consistency tends to point us towards a single inference.</p>
<p>We focus on cross-<em>dataset</em> variability as the primary source of variability in this book. We refer to this variability throughout as cross-<em>linguistic</em> variability, though in fact there are a number of caveats that must be stated. First, many things vary between datasets far beyond language (as noted above). And second, some datasets represent the same language in different dialects (e.g., Australian and British English). Some even reflect the same language and dialect, measured using two different instruments (e.g., the two Beijing Mandarin datasets). In some cases, we can even leverage these parallels to help us rule out alternative explanations. The reasons we focus on cross-dataset variability are three.</p>
<p>First, datasets vary so much that – assuming this variation is somewhat random – claims of consistency are stronger when they emerge from this sort of data. Imagine, counterfactually, that all of the instruments we used had exactly the same structure and item set, and all were administered identically. Certainly, this lack of variation would make our life easier in a number of ways when making quantitative comparisons between datasets! But, it also then means that these consistencies would be confounded in our data – particular item sets (plausibly) or administration instructions (somewhat less plausibly), or both, could be the source of an observed consistency in the data. In contrast, while the messiness and inconsistency of the data in the Wordbank dataset make many aspects of our analysis much harder, it actually increases the strength of the inferences we can draw when – despite this – we see some phenomenon emerge with striking consistency.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Second, the genesis of the investigations documented in this book was in part the observation that several phenomena that we examined were strikingly consistent across languages. For example, the gender effects shown in Chapter <a href="demographics.html#demographics">6</a> were much more consistent than any of us thought <span class="citation">(being at the time ignorant about the previous literature in this particular area; Eriksson et al. <a href="references.html#ref-eriksson2012">2012</a>)</span>. Empirically, we found a lot to look at that was both surprising and interpretable when we examined well-known signatures as they varied across languages. Thus, our motivation is in part the emergent success of this approach.</p>
<p>The final reason we consider cross-language variability as our primary lever is a negative one. The obvious competitor as a source of variability is variation across individuals. We examine this variability briefly in Chapters <a href="psychometrics.html#psychometrics">4</a> and <a href="vocabulary.html#vocabulary">5</a> and more extensively in Chapter <a href="style.html#style">14</a>. While we document substantial and stable variability across individuals <span class="citation">(echoing Bates et al. <a href="references.html#ref-bates1994">1994</a>)</span>, this variability empirically proves to be less of a lever into theoretical issues of interest than we would hope. One reason for this is data-related – we have far more cross-sectional than longitudinal data in the Wordbank dataset – and hence, we cannot track stability and change over time as easily or powerfully as we would like. Further, we have very few additional measures on most children in the dataset (beyond the occasional broad demographic feature, such as maternal education). In addition, as we show in Chapter <a href="style.html#style">14</a>, though there is some reliable stylistic variation between children, much of the apparent variability in children’s style of language learning can be traced to variation in rate. Thus, and in contrast to the exciting emergent conclusions from cross-linguistic variation, individual variation appears to be a less powerful theoretical lever.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, individual variation across individuals does exist and it is robust. Indeed, in Chapter <a href="vocabulary.html#vocabulary">5</a>, we show remarkable consistency across languages in the extent to which there is variability across individuals. We remain optimistic that continuing to explore the extent and consistency of this variability will continue to provide a window into the universal processes that guide learning for the mythical “model” child, as well as define the upper- and lower-limits on typical development.</p>
<p>In Chapter <a href="conclusion-consistency.html#conclusion-consistency">15</a>, we bring together estimates of variability of individual signatures from each of the earlier constituent chapters. We combine these into a single, data-driven continuum from absolute consistency to high variability, and use this continuum to drive speculations about the sorts of mechanisms that would produce a particular set of consistencies.</p>
</div>
<div id="process-universals" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Process universals</h2>
<div id="preconditions" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.4.1</span> Preconditions</h3>
<p>Imagine we were to uncover an aspect of language development that was completely consistent across languages. (Surprisingly, as we will see in Chapter <a href="conclusion-consistency.html#conclusion-consistency">15</a> there are some!). What could we then infer from this observation? Not much, it turns out. The observed regularity could be due to different sources in different datasets or it could be uninteresting from a theoretical perspective.</p>
<p>First, even if the consistency is interesting, any inference from it will always be abductive – an inference backwards from observation to cause These abductive inferences will always be under-constrained and tentative, thus they will always be at best empirically-grounded speculations that should be brought together with other data to make a test. In some sense, this is the fundamental caveat governing our entire enterprise here. The research design is correlational and so definitive causal inferences are not possible.</p>
<p>Inferences can go wrong even within this more limited correlational paradigm. For example, we might observe that, across languages, a particular word (or more precisely, the set of word forms corresponding to the same concept) was always produced earliest. It could be the case that the word happened to be learned earliest in some languages because it was short and easy to pronounce, while in other languages, it was learned early due to a high frequency of usage in the input. This example illustrates the difficulties of reverse inference from consistency. Similarly, we could observe that a certain distributional form always described children’s vocabulary estimates, across languages. This regularity could be due to the operation of the central limit theorem rather than any interesting or substantive mechanism that we might be interested in as psychologists.</p>
<p>These problems mean that we need to have two (somewhat informal) conditions on the consistencies that we posit. First, we need to consider the possibility of multiple routes to the same observed consistency. To the extent that observed regularities are specific and surprising, it will be less likely that there are multiple routes across different languages to observing the same thing. Second, for any potential causal story that we posit, we need to be able to posit a plausible or interesting causal story that does <em>not</em> generate the observed regularity. The tightness of this comparison with a counterfactual governs the strength of the inference.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-nature-of-the-processes" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.4.2</span> The nature of the processes</h3>
<p>Suppose a consistency we identify meets the conditions we describe above: it is sufficiently surprising that we do not see a parsimonious story for how the data for different languages could have been generated by different processes, and there are close counterfactuals in which this consistency did not emerge. Further, in our example, suppose we have a sufficiently large and diverse set of languages and cultures represented in our dataset such that we can justify using the title “universal” rather than the more descriptive and limited term “consistency.” We can then imagine trying to constrain the nature of the sort of universal that could give rise to this type of consistency.</p>
<p>What can we say about putative universals? By virtue of the learning problem that they arise from, they cannot be universals of <em>content</em>. A child’s vocabulary is made up of individual words, each arising from a set of specific interactional circumstances (e.g., the trip to the zoo where a giraffe was seen for the first time). And each of these words is – of course – specific to a particular language. Thus, there is no viable sense in which any possible universals for vocabulary learning can be content universals: no particular content of this type could be innately given. For this reason, we describe these as “process” universals: they relate to the process by which each individual extracts a lexicon from their own idiosyncratic linguistic experiences.</p>
<p>Further, since these processes are fundamentally learning processes, they operate at the timescale of moment-to-moment interactions <span class="citation">(Frank, Goodman, and Tenenbaum <a href="references.html#ref-frank2009">2009</a>; McMurray, Horst, and Samuelson <a href="references.html#ref-mcmurray2012">2012</a>)</span>. In contrast, using the CDI, we observe the accretion of vocabulary and linguistic competence over the course of millions of these interactions <span class="citation">(see e.g., Dupoux <a href="references.html#ref-dupoux2018">2018</a> for estimates)</span>. This mismatch makes inferences about the nature of the processes even trickier. We are studying “macro-economic” indicators about the global outcomes of the learning system, hoping to connect these to the micro-economic dynamics of individual “markets” for specific words.</p>
<!-- We discuss some of these timescale issues in Chapter \@ref(items-prediction).  -->
<p>Yet, from the perspective of the language learning literature, there are still obvious candidates for the sort of universals we are talking about. The general idea of “statistical learning” is one <span class="citation">(Saffran, Aslin, and Newport <a href="references.html#ref-saffran1996">1996</a>; Saffran and Kirkham <a href="references.html#ref-saffran2018">2018</a>)</span>. From a very early age, children are sensitive to regularities in their sensory environments and track statistical associations between elements in these environments. Concrete examples of these mechanisms in action include the tracking of syllable-to-syllable conditional probabilities <span class="citation">(Saffran, Aslin, and Newport <a href="references.html#ref-saffran1996">1996</a>)</span> and the tracking of word-referent correspondences <span class="citation">(Smith and Yu <a href="references.html#ref-smith2008">2008</a>)</span>, but in principle these mechanisms are likely operating over every level of representation present in early language <span class="citation">(Shukla, White, and Aslin <a href="references.html#ref-shukla2011">2011</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This viewpoint is quite consistent with the general perspective of “language as skill learning” advocated by <span class="citation">Chater and Christiansen (<a href="references.html#ref-chater2018">2018</a>)</span>. Since all aspects of language learning are subject to the general dynamics of repetition and practice, we should expect to see effects of word frequency pervasively throughout our data – and indeed we do. These effects manifest themselves directly in Chapter <a href="items-prediction.html#items-prediction">10</a> and perhaps more indirectly in the demographic variation we study in Chapter <a href="demographics.html#demographics">6</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, processes of statistical learning operate in a social context. Statistical learning processes certainly operate over social input that includes information from social partners <span class="citation">(C. Yu and Ballard <a href="references.html#ref-yu2007">2007</a>)</span>. In addition, it is likely that statistical learners take into account the nature of the social context in the inferences that they make <span class="citation">(Frank, Goodman, and Tenenbaum <a href="references.html#ref-frank2009">2009</a>; Shafto, Goodman, and Frank <a href="references.html#ref-shafto2012">2012</a>; Frank, Tenenbaum, and Fernald <a href="references.html#ref-frank2014">2013</a>)</span>. Such social inferences are the focus of much research (including our own). But because they are among the most ephemeral aspects of in-the-moment interactions, they will probably be visible only very indirectly in our data (for example as they are affected by sociodemographic variation, e.g. in Chapter <a href="demographics.html#demographics">6</a>).</p>
<p>Processes of generalization are also strong candidates for process universals. The nature of these generalization mechanisms is of course highly controversial (for all the reasons discussed above), but every account of learning requires some type of generalization from specific lexical items to syntactic constructions or morphological rules <span class="citation">(Tomasello <a href="references.html#ref-tomasello2003">2003</a>; Yang <a href="references.html#ref-yang2016">2016</a>)</span>. We discuss constraints on these generalization processes in Chapter <a href="grammar.html#grammar">13</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, a number of process<em>ing</em> factors might lead to <em>processes</em> that are universal. At the same time as children’s language abilities are growing, a variety of core aspects of cognition are undergoing developmental change as well. Children’s general speed of processing is changing <span class="citation">(Kail <a href="references.html#ref-kail1991">1991</a>; Frank, Lewis, and MacDonald <a href="references.html#ref-frank2016b">2016</a>)</span> – including changes in memory <span class="citation">(Ross-sheehy, Oakes, and Luck <a href="references.html#ref-ross-sheehy2003">2003</a>; Rovee-Collier <a href="references.html#ref-rovee-collier1997">1997</a>)</span>, attention <span class="citation">(Colombo <a href="references.html#ref-colombo2001">2001</a>)</span>, and executive function <span class="citation">(Davidson et al. <a href="references.html#ref-davidson2006">2006</a>)</span>. Processing factors also influence the speed and efficiency with which children can comprehend words in real time, linking both to developmental change and individual differences that are stable and meaningful and that extend beyond language <span class="citation">(Fernald and Marchman <a href="references.html#ref-fernald2012">2012</a>; Marchman and Fernald <a href="references.html#ref-marchman2008">2008</a>; Marchman and Dale <a href="references.html#ref-marchman2017">2017</a>)</span>. Although much of the developmental literature on these cognitive constructs focuses either on infancy or the preschool years – because one- and two-year-olds are hard to measure with standard cognitive psychology tasks – the assumption is that these processes are developing continuously throughout the period we focus on here. These developmental changes mean that the processes that we describe are themselves not static but – inasmuch as they draw on these capacities – they are themselves a moving target.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to note that process universals need not be internal to the child.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Instead, they may be universals of interaction between children and their caregivers. Such processes could lead to the emergence of specific signatures just as well as processes internal to the learner. To take a concrete example, the timing of turn-taking in conversation is an example of one such proposed interactional universal <span class="citation">(Stivers et al. <a href="references.html#ref-stivers2009">2009</a>)</span>. In particular, it is entirely possible that some of the specific consistencies in the content of children’s early vocabulary (Chapter <a href="items-consistency.html#items-consistency">8</a>) that we observe in fact emerge from the nature of children’s early environments, including universal features of what children and their caregivers talk about and why.</p>
</div>
<div id="alternatives" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.4.3</span> Alternatives</h3>
<p>In Chapter <a href="conclusion-consistency.html#conclusion-consistency">15</a>, we will examine the empirical support for the claim of consistent signatures in language learning across languages. Yet our further claim is that these consistencies are supported by universal processes. To examine whether there is content to the claim of process universals, it is helpful to consider the alternative hypothesis. One important alternative is that the process of language acquisition is specific and particular, rather than universal. Two prominent particulars pull against universal tendencies.</p>
<p>The first is the vast semantic and syntactic variation across the world’s languages. For example, as illustrated by <span class="citation">Slobin (<a href="references.html#ref-slobin1996">1996</a>)</span> and others, languages vary dramatically in the ways that they assign semantic content to verbs. If the semantic partition of verbs led to large-scale differences in the timeline or mechanism of acquisition, we might see systematic differences in the predictors of age of acquisition for verbs in these languages, yet we do not. Further, languages are more and less morphologically complex; while the most highly morphologically-complex, polysynthetic languages are not represented in Wordbank, we do have data from relatively less complex (Mandarin) and more complex (Russian) languages. If morphosyntax were relatively more or less important in the acquisition of particular languages, we might expect radical differences in the noun bias, the grammar-lexicon correlation, or the predictors of age of acquisition across languages. Yet, we do not observe these. Of course, there is always room for finer-grained predictions – with more detailed predictive models and better typological coverage, perhaps we will discover such signatures. Our point here is merely that – to the extent that we observe consistencies, neither morphosyntactic nor semantic variability across languages dominates the process of vocabulary acquisition.</p>
<p>The second set of language-specific particulars that might lead to variance across languages is the vast cultural variability across the communities represented in the Wordbank data. Our data contain both “individualist” and “collectivist” cultures <span class="citation">(Markus and Kitayama <a href="references.html#ref-markus1991">1991</a>; Nisbett et al. <a href="references.html#ref-nisbett2001">2001</a>)</span> as well as both “loose fit” and “tight fit” cultures <span class="citation">(Gelfand et al. <a href="references.html#ref-gelfand2011">2011</a>)</span>. To the extent that parenting differs across these cultures – and there is good evidence that it does <span class="citation">(e.g., Bornstein <a href="references.html#ref-bornstein2013">2013</a>)</span> – we should see variance in the trajectory of language learning. For example, it would be quite reasonable to predict that the female advantage in vocabulary acquisition might vary as a function of cross-national gender biases <span class="citation">(Nosek et al. <a href="references.html#ref-nosek2009">2009</a>)</span>. Yet it is strikingly consistent overall (presaging the conclusions in Chapter <a href="demographics.html#demographics">6</a>), again arguing that – at the broadest level, at least – variable cultural factors do not dominate other processes in the acquisition of vocabulary.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="replication-and-theory-building-conclusions" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Replication and theory-building: Conclusions</h2>
<p>In this chapter, we have sketched a bit of what we see to be the unique theoretical contributions of work with a much larger dataset than is usual in developmental language acquisition research. In a nutshell, doing this work at scale allows for the identification of sources of variability in the “signatures” of language learning. What these signatures are is a matter for further development – each chapter will describe and motivate the particular signatures that it includes. Further, the consistency of these signatures can provide a motivation for positing process universals that underlie the emergence of these signatures (pending the caveats stated above). We return to the general picture of language learning that emerges from our study in Chapter <a href="conclusion-scale.html#conclusion-scale">16</a>.</p>
<p>One final note about the theory that emerges from the work we do here. One set of concepts that is subsumed in our interest in consistency is that theory be supported by observations that are reproducible, replicable, and robust <span class="citation">(Munafò et al. <a href="references.html#ref-munafo2017">2017</a>)</span>. A theory of consistencies is, again, <em>a fortiori</em> all of these. If a particular characteristic can be shown again and again across individuals, samples, and languages it is replicable. Indeed, one view of our enterprise is that its impact is fundamentally in the consolidation of knowledge through unifying – replicating – previous work.</p>
<p>Crudely put, we have compiled all of the CDI data that we could, and all of the CDI analyses, and executed the cross of analyses and datasets. This project is thus a cross-linguistic replication study. And so, when we state that some phenomenon is consistent across languages, it is by definition replicated – but it is additionally robust to a number of different procedural decisions (such as the design or administration of the CDI form) that end up varying widely in our data.</p>
<p>Finally, this work is also fully computationally reproducible – the analytic conclusions we draw here based on a set of open data and code that can be rerun to create the figures and tables in the manuscript. This characteristic alone does not guarantee their correctness, but their provenance is known.</p>
