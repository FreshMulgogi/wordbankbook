<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 14</span> Individual Variation in Vocabulary</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Of all the individual differences described to date in the literature on early child language, variations in rate present the least interesting challenge to traditional ‘universalist’ models of development, If it can be shown that all children go through the same basic sequence, activating a common set of structures and processes, then small variations in the onset time for specific language milestones might represent little more than a minor perturbation to a maturational theory (like variations in the onset of puberty). <em>Putative variations in style of development are more problematic, because they raise questions about the order in which structures are acquired, and the mechanisms used to acquire those structures.</em> <span class="citation">(Bates et al. <a href="references.html#ref-bates1994">1994</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Preceeding chapters have dealt with the degree of variability between individuals in Chapter <a href="vocabulary.html#vocabulary">5</a> and the stability of individuals’ learning in Chapter <a href="psychometrics.html#psychometrics">4</a>. Then Chapters <a href="demographics.html#demographics">6</a> and <a href="items-demographics.html#items-demographics">9</a> used demographic factors to explain variability. In general, our treatment of variability has focused on issues of learning rate in the sense discussed by Bates et al. in the quote above (or, to be more precise, vocabulary size). With the exception of Chapter <a href="items-demographics.html#items-demographics">9</a>, which examined the rate of learning individual words, we have not dealt yet with issues of <em>style</em>.</p>
<p>What does it mean for two children to show differences in language learning style? Intuitively, children who vary in style of learning should differ in some aspect(s) of the learning process. Unfortunately, from the data that we use here, we cannot observe process – we can only observe the outcome of learning: knowledge. Thus, children must exhibit some differences in the way their vocabulary grows. This difference could be distributional and inferred indirectly from cross-sectional data or it could be shown directly through longitudinal data (though this move limits the number of datasets we can use from Wordbank).</p>
<p>One prominent candidate for a stylistic difference in language acquisition is the distinction between “referential” and “expressive” children. In an early report on individual differences in vocabulary acquisition, <span class="citation">K. Nelson (<a href="references.html#ref-nelson1973">1973</a>)</span> noticed that there was substantial variation in how many nouns children had in their vocabularies. Children who had more than half of their vocabulary devoted to nouns were named “referential” children. They tended to have speech that was less syntactically complex than other children and showed faster vocabulary growth. In contrast, “expressive” children had speech that was more syntactically complex and had fewer nouns. <span class="citation">Dore (<a href="references.html#ref-dore1974">1974</a>)</span> proposed a related version of this distinction, focusing on speech acts from two children in the middle of the second year and labeling them as “code oriented” (focused on labeling, similar to “referential”) vs. “message oriented” (instrumental, social requests, similar to “expressive”).</p>
<p>Since this seminal work, the referential/expressive distinction has become enshrined in the literature as a canonical aspect of variation in children’s style. Yet further debate about the consequences of this stylistic distinction continued in the literature. For example, <span class="citation">Bates, Bretherton, and Snyder (<a href="references.html#ref-bates1988">1988</a>)</span> observed a correlation between the proportion of nouns in the children’s vocabulary and their vocabulary size and suggested the possibility that a referential style might be more effective for learning. Reacting to this claim, <span class="citation">J. M. Pine and Lieven (<a href="references.html#ref-pine1990">1990</a>)</span> argued that the direction of causality might be reversed, however: perhaps having a bigger vocabulary (at least at a certain point) would lead to a greater representation for nouns.<a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>While exploring the referential/expressive phenomenon more rigorously, <span class="citation">Bates et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-bates1994">1994</a>)</span> presented analyses largely supporting that view: much systematic variation in the “referentiality” (proportion nouns) in children’s vocabularies was due to the size of their vocabulary. As children’s vocabularies grow, they tend to increase in their over-representation of nouns (as shown also in Chapter <a href="categories-syntactic.html#categories-syntactic">11</a>). Thus, two children of the same age who have different proportions of nouns may also have different overall vocabulary sizes. After controlling for this factor, <span class="citation">Bates et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-bates1994">1994</a>)</span> found only more limited evidence for stylistic variation. In the first subsection of this chapter, we pick up these analyses and apply them broadly to our dataset.</p>
<p>A second area of stylistic variation that has been much discussed is whether some children go through a vocabulary “spurt,” defined as a change in the rate of vocabulary growth. The idea of a “spurt” or “explosion” occurs in a wide variety of discussions of early vocabulary <span class="citation">(e.g., K. Nelson <a href="references.html#ref-nelson1973">1973</a>; Kamhi <a href="references.html#ref-kamhi1986">1986</a>; Bates, Bretherton, and Snyder <a href="references.html#ref-bates1988">1988</a>, see e.g., <span class="citation">Dapretto and Bjork (<a href="references.html#ref-dapretto2000">2000</a>)</span> for review)</span>. Clearly, from the average growth rates observed in Chapter <a href="vocabulary.html#vocabulary">5</a>, children’s vocabulary growth accelerates dramatically during the period following their first birthday and the emergence of first word production. Investigations of this acceleration have focused on two distinct features: its explanation and its variation across children.</p>
<p>Although there has been a tremendous amount of discussion of the explanations for accelerations in vocabulary growth, we will not investigate this topic further here. Our data do not allow us to investigate issues of mechanistic process directly or of what cognitive or social changes are co-temporanous with the vocabulary spurt. In addition, a short but convincing analysis by <span class="citation">McMurray (<a href="references.html#ref-mcmurray2007">2007</a>)</span> suggests that such acceleration is over-determined in the sense that it will likely emerge from almost any plausible acquisition mechanism(s). Assuming that words vary in difficulty as a normal distribution, vocabulary growth will naturally accelerate with increases in a child’s ability. Thus, making reverse inferences from the presence of acceleration to a particular mechanism is unwarranted.</p>
<p>The second issue – variation in acceleration across children – is related to our aim here, however. Does every child’s vocabulary acceleration follow the same general pattern, or is there substantial variation in the type of growth that is followed, for example, in the point at which acceleration begins, or the specific shape of the growth curve? <span class="citation">Ganger and Brent (<a href="references.html#ref-ganger2004">2004</a>)</span> report a systematic study of a subpart of this issue: whether there is a discontinuity in growth rate for individual children. Definining a spurt specifically as a change in the rate of acceleration, they conduct a quantitative analysis of whether such a change occurs. Our second set of analyses follows up on this general issue.</p>
<p>The final area of stylistic variation that we address in our third subsection is the dissociation between comprehension and production. It has been long acknowledged that children tend to understand more than they can say <span class="citation">(e.g., Eve V Clark and Hecht <a href="references.html#ref-clark1983">1983</a>)</span>. But, to what extent does this generalization vary across children? That is, are there some children who are more fluent producers vs. others who have a large vocabulary in comprehension but more limited production? At the clinical extreme, significant variation in this respect must be present, because there are some children with various apraxias of speech that have strong comprehension but serious production difficulties. At the other extreme, delays in early comprehension have clinical relevance, and are often thought to be a more reliable indicator of language delays compared to production alone <span class="citation">(e.g., Rescorla <a href="references.html#ref-rescorla2009">2009</a>; Thal, Tobias, and Morrison <a href="references.html#ref-thal1991">1991</a>)</span>. While both of these extremes are interesting and important, the question for us is whether, in a typically-developing population, we can detect systematic variation on this dimension over the full range of language abilities.</p>
<!-- VIRGINIA, ARE THERE SOME REFERENCES HERE? CLARK 1983? -->
<!-- In general, the methodological issue of this chapter is that there are many measures we can define regarding individual variability, and the trick will be telling signal from noise (and from artifact). We typically rely on three strategies. The first is to ask whether a particular measure is valid in the sense that it is related to some other aspect of the data. We are in the position of not having independent validation measures to apply to, but we can still reasonably ask whether one measure (e.g., proportion of nouns) is related to another (e.g., vocabulary for age). The second strategy is -- as throughout -- to look for consistency across samples in a particular pattern. Such consistency suggests some signal, though in each case we will try to be cautious about differentiating this signal from statistical artifact. The third strategy is to look for consistency in a particular measure throughout development (e.g., evaluating "test-retest" reliability of a measure).  -->
<!-- Further, idiosyncrasy in children's vocabulary is an interesting measure suggested by @mayor2014. -->
<div id="variation-in-vocabulary-composition" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.1</span> Variation in vocabulary composition</h2>
<p>In this subsection we examine the question of variation across children in referential vs. expressive vocabulary. Following <span class="citation">Bates et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-bates1994">1994</a>)</span>, we operationalize the notion of a “referential” vocabulary as one that has a greater proportion of nouns relative to other classes (the definition of “noun” is the same here as in Chapter <a href="categories-syntactic.html#categories-syntactic">11</a>. While there might be other more nuanced measures that we could construct, this one has the advantage of being directly related to the framework in Chapter <a href="categories-syntactic.html#categories-syntactic">11</a>; thus, we use that same framework to investigate vocabulary composition in individuals here.</p>
<!-- Recall that we computed the proportion of children's vocabulary that was made up of nouns as a function of age in that chapter.  -->
<p><img src="wordbank-book_files/figure-html/style-re_beginning-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The proportion of children’s vocabulary that is made up of nouns is shown in the figure above. There is a general trend for an over-representation of nouns, as shown by the blue line (representing the smoothed mean proportion nouns) being above the red dashed line (total porportion nouns on the form). The size of this over-representation is the topic of Chapter <a href="categories-syntactic.html#categories-syntactic">11</a>. Here we examine its variability across children.</p>
<p>Is a referential style associated with having a larger vocabulary? The proportion of nouns in a child’s vocabulary should then be a predictor of vocabulary size, over and above age.</p>
<p><img src="wordbank-book_files/figure-html/style-vc_coefs-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>A simple model of this hypothesis is a GLM predicting the number of CDI words a child produces as a function of age and proportion nouns.<a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The coefficients of such a model, fit to the data from each language, are shown above. Age coefficients are positive, indicating more words with age. Proportion of nouns is also negative, indicating that having more nouns is related to a smaller vocabulary, controlling for age. (Standard errors are plotted, but are typically tiny and hence invisible.) This result appears to provide support for the <em>opposite</em> to the claimed relationship between the referential/expressive distinction and vocabulary size. Those children with more referential vocabularies have <em>smaller</em> vocabularies, controlling for age.</p>
<p>The trouble is that these variables – age, noun bias, and total vocabulary size – have a complex relationship to one another. For a young child, having a bigger noun bias is correlated with having a bigger vocabulary (because they are on the early part of the “noun over-representation” curve shown in Chapter <a href="categories-syntactic.html#categories-syntactic">11</a>). In contrast, for an older child, having a bigger noun bias is correlated with having a smaller vocabulary because they are on the later part of the curve. Thus, the directionality of the relationship that you discover is largely determined by what part of your sample is densest.</p>
<p>Put another way, proportion nouns could be predictive of vocabulary size not because children with a particular style have bigger vocabularies, but because having more nouns in your vocabulary tends to indicate that you are further along a standard prorgession. Put another way, perhaps all children follow the same trajectory through the noun bias. Even in this scenario, knowing the size of a child’s noun bias will tell you something about vocabulary size, without that implying that the child is following a different trajectory. This point is made in different ways by both <span class="citation">Bates et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-bates1994">1994</a>)</span> and <span class="citation">Lieven, Pine, and Barnes (<a href="references.html#ref-lieven1992">1992</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>One way to circumvent this critique statistically is to measure whether a particular child has a greater-than-average, vocabulary-adjusted noun-bias. In other words, if we remove the average correlation with noun bias and vocabulary, can we still find a relation with individuals’ degree of noun bias and vocabulary size?</p>
<p><img src="wordbank-book_files/figure-html/style-vc_eng-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The figure above shows both the English noun-proportion data (plotted now by vocabulary size) and the residuals of that distribution when fit via a cubic model (blue curve). The next question we can ask is how this “residualized style” relates to other variables like age, grammatical ability, and (in longitudinal data) further vocabulary growth. Note that we cannot compare this variable to other aspects of concurrent vocabulary size because features like, for example, number of closed class items in the vocabulary are non-independent (since the more nouns you have, by definition the fewer closed class items).</p>
<p><img src="wordbank-book_files/figure-html/style-vc_resids-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Our first analysis looks at the correlation between vocabulary-residualized noun bias and age. The plot above shows coefficient estimates on this analysis. Now most age coefficients are reliably negative, suggesting that a greater residual noun bias is associated with being <em>younger</em>. Two of the main outliers here are from Mandarin, which, as discussed in Chapter <a href="categories-syntactic.html#categories-syntactic">11</a>, has the smallest noun bias of any of the languages in our dataset.</p>
<p>Next we examine correlations with grammatical ability. <span class="citation">Lieven, Pine, and Barnes (<a href="references.html#ref-lieven1992">1992</a>)</span> was interested in the possibility that an alternative route into language from a referential style would be the use of construction-based generalizations.</p>
<p><img src="wordbank-book_files/figure-html/style-grammar_correlations_complexity-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /> For grammatical complexity scores, we see that vocabulary-residualized noun bias is reliably related to grammatical complexity. Because of the residualization procedure, this relationship is over and above the correlations between grammar and lexicon (as reported in Chapter <a href="grammar.html#grammar">13</a>). Thus, those children with more nouns than expected for their vocabulary size produce <em>less</em> complex language. (Again, Mandarin is an exception). As seen above, they are also <em>younger</em> than expected.</p>
<p><img src="wordbank-book_files/figure-html/style-grammar_correlations_complexity_age-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We next repeat the analysis of complexity while controlling for age and total production. The coefficients are shown above. Production of course has a positive relationship to grammatical complexity, as does age (see Chapter <a href="grammar.html#grammar">13</a>). Even controlling for these two factors, however, we still observe a consistent negative relationship between residual noun bias and complexity.</p>
<p>Summarizing, we were interested in this subsection in whether we found cross-linguistic evidence for different styles of language learing, in particular, individual differences that mapped onto the referential vs. expressive distinction. Operationalizing this distinction, we asked whether children with a larger noun bias show differences in their language learning trajectory than children with a smaller noun bias. The relations between overall noun bias and vocabulary are complex to interpret due to the non-linear relationships between these variables and age. To circumvent this, we examined a residualized noun bias measure that controls for total vocabulary. This measure was related to age and to grammatical complexity: children with relatively more nouns in their vocabulary tended to be younger and to be producing less complex speech, across languages.</p>
<p>Taken together, these data provide some cross-linguistic support for the idea that children show variability beyond differences in rate of vocabulary acqisition. One dimension of variability is that, for a particular level of vocabulary size, there appear to be children who are younger, know more nouns, and combine words less (perhaps the “referential” children referred to in previous literature); other children will tend to be older, have a more diverse vocabulary (including more predicates), and will tend to use these to combine words more.</p>
</div>
<div id="spurts-in-vocabulary" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.2</span> “Spurts” in vocabulary</h2>
<p><img src="wordbank-book_files/figure-html/style-median_production-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Perhaps the most obvious aspect of early vocabulary is that it picks up speed in growth over the second year after birth. First words are hard-won but soon children’s language appears to “explode.” This acceleration is easily visible in the plot above, which shows the median productive vocabulary from 8 - 18 months (English (American) Words and Gestures data). (We could measure the rate of learning by taking the derivative of this curve; but this rate calculation is slightly misleading for cross-sectional data and so we postpone this analysis until below). This increase in the rate of vocabulary learning has been much remarked on in the literature, as discussed above.</p>
<p>Our starting point here is a study by <span class="citation">Ganger and Brent (<a href="references.html#ref-ganger2004">2004</a>)</span>, who provide a detailed, curve-fitting analysis of the question of vocabulary “spurts.” They evaluate whether individual children’s longitudinal growth patterns are better fit by a model with constant acceleration in growth rate, or whether some children have a discontinuous “step” in terms of their growth rate.</p>
<p>In our view, this is a productive approach, but presupposes some descriptive facts about children’s growth rate generally. For example, using longitudinal data, we can simply examine features of rate and acceleration and how they change with time. For these analyses we focus on longitudional production data from Norwegian and English WS and WG forms. Because we are interested in computing (potentially non-linear) changes in rate, we need four datapoints from each child as a minimum, and because we are interested in early changes, we set the restriction that the first time-point reported should have fewer than 50 words reported <span class="citation">(50 words is often used as a semi-arbitrary cutoff for the vocabulary spurt; Dapretto and Bjork <a href="references.html#ref-dapretto2000">2000</a>; Ganger and Brent <a href="references.html#ref-ganger2004">2004</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The decision to exclude children with larger vocabularies at their first recorded measurement means that we have some bias present to include children with slower vocabulary growth. In particular, from the WS data, we exclude a substantial proportion of children even from the youngest groups (e.g., 0.22% of Norwegian 16-month-old). So as not to bias the analysis further by including a large proportion of older, slower learners, we only include children younger than 21 months in this sample.</p>
<p><img src="wordbank-book_files/figure-html/style-spaghetti-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We now have a population of children for whom we can evaluate the rate of vocabulary growth and how it varies as a function of age. This winnowing leaves us with data from 290 children, whose growth curves are shown in the figure above.</p>
<p>We exclude datapoints associated with large decreases in vocabulary (negative rates). Although some small negatives would be expected based on measurement error or forgetting, large negative spikes are rare and likely due to errors in the data (e.g., a partially filled form). We exclude rates of -10 words/month and below (0% of data).</p>
<p><img src="wordbank-book_files/figure-html/style-rateplot-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The figure above shows the child’s estimated growth rate in the measurement period leading up to that month (number of words learned since the last longitudinal measurement divided by number of months since that measurement) plotted by total words produced in that month. There is a clear quadratic shape to this pattern, almost certainly caused by ceiling effects for children who are “running out of words” on the form.</p>
<p><img src="wordbank-book_files/figure-html/style-wg_rates_lm-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The question of vocabulary spurts, as posed by <span class="citation">Ganger and Brent (<a href="references.html#ref-ganger2004">2004</a>)</span>, is the way that vocabulary growth rate increase for individual children. Clearly it increases (because vocabulary growth picks up speed generally) – but does it grow smoothly, indicating constant acceleration? Or does it move from one equilibrium to another (indicating an initial “spurt”)? <span class="citation">Ganger and Brent (<a href="references.html#ref-ganger2004">2004</a>)</span> propose analyzing children’s growth rate as a function not of age, but of total vocabulary. To examine this question, we need to focus in on the initial 250 words when the average rate appears to be increasing linearly (before ceiling effects are found; see red curve above), and identify children with more than 4 CDIs before this time (to ensure sufficient density). Further, we need to examine the rate trajectories of individual children. The plot above shows this analysis for a randomly sampled subset of children in our available datasets.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Ganger and Brent (<a href="references.html#ref-ganger2004">2004</a>)</span> analyzed the question of developmental spurts by fitting different curve types to the rate function in their data. They compared the likelihood ratio of quadratic and logistic rate curves for each child’s data. The quadratic curve represented the hypothesis of smooth growth in rate (smooth acceleration). In contrast, the logistic curve was of the form</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[R \sim \frac{\alpha}{1 - e^{-\beta (W - \gamma)}}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is the rate of acceleration, and it is assumed to be distributed as a function of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, the asymptotic rate, <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, the slope of the change between the initial and final rates, <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> (the total vocabulary), and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>, the point at which the spurt occurs. This curve captures a discrete “spurt” – a movement from one equilibrium to another.</p>
<p><img src="wordbank-book_files/figure-html/style-model_sample_plot-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We fit these functions (as well as a simple linear function) to our data. Fitted curves for children with more than 7 datapoints are shown above. The basic visual impression from these data is that, even with the longitudinal depth we have for individual children, there is substantial uncertainty in the best-fitting curve. However, it does not appear that there are many children who show something that looks clearly like a spurt. A few children rise quickly and then show one datapoint that levels off. But there is a puzzle. We can only confirm that the rate has leveled off if we have data at higher levels of production. But for vocabulary size over 300 words, <em>every</em> child will level off in their rate because they have “run out of words” on the form. This example illustrates some of the difficulties in making strong inferences from data of this type.</p>
<p>We next conducted the full model comparison analysis that <span class="citation">Ganger and Brent (<a href="references.html#ref-ganger2004">2004</a>)</span> conducted, over the 0 separate longitudinal records included.<a href="#fn27" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> In Ganger &amp; Brent’s analysis, they used only two models (linear and quadratic), which had the same number of parameters. Accordingly, they compared only the likelihoods of the data under these models. In contrast, we compared a linear function with intercept at 0 (1 parameter), standard linear (2 parameters), quadratic (3 parameter), and logistic (3 parameter) curves. To make up for the difference in parameters, we computed Akaike’s Information Criterion (a measure of model goodness of fit, where smaller is better) for each model for each participant.</p>

<p>The table above shows the proportion of children in each dataset for which different model types fit best. Overall, children were split between models, with some children best fit by the logistic. The linear functions, which were simpler, however, fit more participants better, with the 1-parameter linear model with no intercept best fitting more children than any other.</p>
<p><img src="wordbank-book_files/figure-html/style-quadratic_kids-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /> The 26 children (out of 101 total) with a best-fitting quadratic model are shown above. Some of these children do appear to have data that are well-fit by the quadratic model. But for many, this fit appears to be the product of a single datapoint; assuming some error, a more parsimonious model (e.g., simple linear) might do just as well. Thus, with more children but less density, our conclusion tends to be similar to <span class="citation">Ganger and Brent (<a href="references.html#ref-ganger2004">2004</a>)</span>: there is limited evidence for a vocabulary spurt in most children.</p>
<p><img src="wordbank-book_files/figure-html/style-roy-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>To further examine this issue in a denser dataset, we used data from <span class="citation">Roy et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-roy2015">2015</a>)</span>’s in-depth study of a single child. This is an ultra-dense dataset with millions of words of transcribed speech and hand-checked age-of-acquisition data for over 600 words up to the child’s second birthday. The comparable curves for this dataset are shown above. Using the same AIC method, the quadratic model fits best, but the linear model is clearly close as well.</p>
<p>Stepping back, in this subsection we examined the growth rate of children’s vocabulary. To a first, group-wise approximation, children’s vocabulary growth accelerates linearly with vocabulary size during the initial period (up to around 250 words). After this point, we run into substantial measurement issues because the CDI does not contain enough words to be certain of the pattern of growth. Further, when we examined individuals’ growth, it also often appeared to be linear or quadratic; only in a minority of individuals was there any evidence for a “spurt” (a discrete change). This conclusion was tempered, however, by the difficulty of drawing conclusions without even denser longitudinal data concerning the very beginnings of language.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.3</span> Variation in production vs. comprehension</h2>
<!-- RELEVANT FOR CLINICAL -->
<!-- CDI DATA HAS AN ARTIFACT - NEED OTHER SOURCES -->
<!-- MANY REASONS FOR PRODUCTION VARIATION -->
<!-- STABLE ACROSS LANGUAGES THOUGH -->
<p>Our next investigation concerns the question of how tightly comprehension and production are yoked within CDI data. Our assumption is that there is variability between children on this dimension – while some children can say a large portion of the words that they understand, others appear to produce less but still understand substantial amounts. How does the ratio of production to comprehension vary across ages, and across languages?</p>
<p>It is important to be clear that some of the pattern in this variable could be due to variation between parents in under- or over-reporting comprehension (or for that matter, production, but we assume – and Chapter <a href="psychometrics.html#psychometrics">4</a> confirms – that production reports likely carries more signal). For example, we might be detecting variation in the threshold at which parents assume that a response indicates comprehension. Some parents might be very liberal and recall a generally-understood story that included a particular word, while others might be searching for a specific anecdote that clearly illustrates comprehension of that word. Compared to the more observable facts of word production, the variation might also reflect that comprehension is a more difficult concept for parents to grasp, so there will be differences in across parents in what “comprehends” means. Nevertheless, there is evidence that children’s level of early comprehension is a useful metric for identifying possible language delays beyond production data alone. That is, children with only a few words who also have low comprehension scores are at increased risk for language delays compared to children with a few words who nonetheless appear to be understanding language well (e.g., <span class="citation">Rescorla (<a href="references.html#ref-rescorla2009">2009</a>)</span>).</p>
<p>Of course, this type of analysis can only be conducted on WG-type forms, because of the presence of comprehension information. We begin by investigating the American English WG data as an example.</p>
<p><img src="wordbank-book_files/figure-html/style-eng_wg-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The figure above shows individual children’s comprehension and production plotted against one another. The diagonal indicates a child who comprehends and produces exactly the same number of words. In practice, this measure is always below the diagonal because, by the design of the form, a child cannot “say but not understand” a particular word, they can only “understand” or “understand and say.” We can convert these data into a productivity ratio:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[productivity = \frac{\# produced}{\# understood}\]</span> and plot this ratio for all children.</p>
<p><img src="wordbank-book_files/figure-html/style-eng_wg_productivity-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /> The resulting scatterplot is quite interpretable. It contains a few outliers at the very top of the range for very young children (whose parents report them producing and comprehending the same number of words). But for most others, the ratio is low, increasing from about 10% to 30% by the top of the form.</p>
<p><img src="wordbank-book_files/figure-html/style-wg_productivity-comprehension-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p><img src="wordbank-book_files/figure-html/style-wg_productivity_subset-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The figure above plots these productivity ratios by language for an age-restricted subset between 8 and 18 months. Plots are sorted by the mean productivity ratio. While the majority of languages show the same pattern as English (an increase from around 10% to 30%) there are some outliers that show a flatter slope.</p>
<p><img src="wordbank-book_files/figure-html/style-wg_productivity-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We can see this pattern even better by plotting the best-fit lines across languages. Nearly all of these go up with age and have similar slopes.</p>
<p><img src="wordbank-book_files/figure-html/style-productivity_coefs-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Going back to the scatter plots, however, in nearly every language to one degree or another, we see some number ratios &gt; .95, indicating that parents are essentially not using “understands” as a separate option.</p>

<p>The table above shows the proportion of children showing more than 95% productivity. A number of samples have substantial proportions of parents reporting comprehension in this way. While it is possible that these numbers represent actual children whose production is synchronized with their comprehension, a more parsimonious explanation is that there are local variations in administration, leading to some fraction of parents who are not completing the form properly. In particular, it does not appear that these “no comprehension without production” children are the tail of a shifted distribution of productivity ratios; instead, they appear to be due to a separate small population. Yet despite that they appear to have an outsized effect on our estimates of the development of productivity ratios across languages.</p>
<p>In sum, although the relationship between production and comprehension is a fascinating locus for individual differences, we may not be able to measure this relationship effectively using cross-linguistic comprehension data. Further, these analyses underscore the importance of developing instructions for parents that more effectively convey the concept of what it means for a child to “understand” a word. Outside of these concerns, while there very well may be reliable variation in the production-comprehension ratio across children, we unfortunately do not have access to independent signals that could validate this quantity.</p>

<div id="discussion-8" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.4</span> Discussion</h2>
<p>In this chapter, we have explored three classic indices of individual variation in children’s “style” of learning, that is, variation in how children approach the task of language learning. Compared to differences in rate/timing of learning, stylistic differences have been proposed to be a stronger test of the proposal that language acquisition is a constructed process. But, few studies to date have had the power and scope to explore the extent of these differences crosslinguistically.</p>
<p>We can summarize the conclusions from our various different sub-analyses. First, we were not able to substantiate differences between individuals in production/comprehension differences. It is tricky to use comprehension data to estimate variability between individuals in how much they produce vs. comprehend, due to likely cross-linguistic differences in the uptake of instructions regarding comprehension. In contrast, we did see support for the traditional referential vs. expressive distinction from cross-linguistic analysis. We found that, even at a given level of vocabulary size, some children tend to be younger, use more nouns, and combine less; others tend to be older, know more predicates, and combine words more. Finally, confirming previous work by <span class="citation">Ganger and Brent (<a href="references.html#ref-ganger2004">2004</a>)</span>, we found no evience supporting a “vocabulary spurt.” Instead, we found that, while vocabulary growth accelerates, that acceleration is approximately linear for the first 250 words, and hence a “vocabulary spurt” is not reliably observed across most children.</p>
<p>In sum, our analysis does confirm the existence of stable individual variation in language learning “style.” Our work also highlights the methodological difficulty of this enterprise, however; despite the tremendous amount of data we have access to, our analyses still suffer from the limitations of the parent-report format of the CDI; it is often difficult to tell whether we are measuring children’s style or parents’. Overcoming this limitation would require non-parent report measures with equivalent domain breadth, psychometric stability, and sample diversity to the CDI; at present to our knowledge, no publicly available datasets of this type exist.</p>
