<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> The Data</h1>
<p>We begin by introducing our dataset and the database that contains it. Our starting place is the basic structure of CDI data. Some material in this chapter is adapted from <span class="citation">Frank et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-frank2016">2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<div id="database" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Database</h2>
<p>Why use a database to store vocabulary data? Consider the standard format of raw CDI data. Here is a small slice of the original CDI norming data <span class="citation">(Fenson et al. <a href="references.html#ref-fenson1994">1994</a>; Fenson et al. <a href="references.html#ref-fenson2007">2007</a>)</span>.</p>

<p class="caption">Example data from the CDI norming sample (Fenson et al., 2007). Each row has a unique child identifier, demographics, and word-by-word checklist data.</p>
</div>
<p>Each row is a child, each column gives a variable – either a demographic variable or the result of a particular word being administered to a particular child. Although this format is useful for homogeneous administrations of a single instrument, it cannot accommodate multiple instruments, multiple languages, or datasets with different sources or kinds of demographic information. Consolidating data across different instruments is very difficult in this format, and tracking data on children with multiple longitudinal administrations of a single instrument must also be done in an ad-hoc manner. The move to a database format allows far more flexible and programmatic handling of heterogeneous data structures from different sources.</p>
<div id="database-architecture" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Database Architecture</h3>
<p>A relational database such as Wordbank is at its heart an ontology: a set of entities that are described in a series of tables linked by unique identifiers. The primary entities in the Wordbank database are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Instrument</strong>: A specific parent-report survey or questionnaire with a particular set of items. For example, the American English Words and Sentences form is an individual instrument.</li>
<li><strong>Item</strong>: A particular question on an instrument. A specific word like “dog” is our canonical CDI item, but other items include questions about gestures, morphological and syntactic complexity, and other aspects of early language or behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Administration</strong>: A particular instance of an instrument being given to a child, with an associated child age and source (the contributing lab).</li>
<li><strong>Child</strong>: A unique individual, with associated demographics.</li>
<li><strong>Language</strong>: A particular language or language community for which a CDI instrument has been adapted. Note that this definition of language distinguishes e.g. American and British English.</li>
</ul>
<p>These entities are related by two primary groups of tables in Wordbank. The <em>common</em> tables store data that is shared between CDI instruments, including information about <em>administrations</em> (individual instances of a form being filled out for a child), and <em>items</em> (words and other questions on a form). Then the <em>instrument</em> tables store the item-by-item response data for particular CDI instruments. We currently include all items on CDI instruments, including questions about communication, gesture, morphology, and grammar (though in many of the datasets that we archive these non-vocabulary questions have not been digitized so data on these are sparse at present; see e.g., Chapters <a href="#gesture"><strong>??</strong></a> and <a href="grammar.html#grammar">11</a>).</p>
<p>Wordbank is designed so that it can accommodate data from a wide variety of instruments, both within and across languages. Indeed, at the time of writing, the site includes data from more than 71933 administrations of the CDI across 25 different languages and 48 different instruments.</p>
</div>
<div id="implementation" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> Implementation</h3>
<p>Wordbank is constructed using free, open-source tools. The database is a standard <code>MySQL</code> database, managed using <code>Python</code> and <code>Django</code>. In practice, however, all access is through an <code>R</code> application programming interface (API) that constructs individual SQL calls. This API is distributed to <code>R</code> users through the <code>wordbankr</code> package, which is available through the Comprehensive R Network (CRAN). For details on how to use <code>wordbankr</code>, see <span class="citation">Frank et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-frank2016">2016</a>)</span>. All code for wordbank is hosted in GitHub repositories, with the <a href="http://github.com/langcog/wordbank">primary site repository</a> containing data and database code, the <a href="http://github.com/langcog/wordbankr">r package repository</a> containing code for the API, and the <a href="http://github.com/langcog/wordbank-book">book repository</a> containing the code and text for this manuscript.</p>
<p>All data uploaded to Wordbank are open and freely available for download, both through the site itself and through the GitHub repository. The site includes only de-identified data that cannot be linked to individual parents and children under US Department of Health and Human Services’ “Safe Harbor” standard. Because of these features, the Stanford Institutional Review Board has determined that the Wordbank project does not constitute human subjects research.</p>
</div>
<div id="cross-linguistic-and-cross-instrument-comparison" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.3</span> Cross-linguistic and cross-instrument comparison</h3>
<p>The general philosophy of the CDI has been summarized as “adaptation, not translation” [<span class="citation">P. S. Dale (<a href="references.html#ref-dale2015">2015</a>)</span>; see Chapter <a href="intro.html#intro">1</a>]. In other words, CDIs are a useful tool for many languages, but the forms differ between languages – words and even whole sections are added, dropped, and modified to ensure that the form captures the details of the particular language for which it is designed. To date, more than 60 adaptations of the original English CDI have been documented <span class="citation">(P. S. Dale and Penfold <a href="references.html#ref-dale2011">2011</a>)</span>. These forms vary widely, including differences in length and intended age range. Some forms include hundreds of items more than the original 680 words on the English Words &amp; Sentences form; others are so-called ``short forms’’ and include only a hundred or a few hundred carefully selected words. Some are designed to capture development from the emergence of language through ages 3–4 years, while others are focused on very early development (like the English Words &amp; Gestures form, designed for ages 8–18 months).</p>
<p>The wide cross-linguistic adoption of the CDI provides an opportunity for cross-linguistic comparison but it also creates many challenges that are not present in datasets that are designed from the start for such comparions. Differences in instruments and items as well as differences in samples and administration conditions all make it potentially quite problematic to compare scores and score distributions across forms. We discuss differences in instruments and items here and defer discussion of differences in samples and administration to the section on Data below.</p>
<p>Obviously differences in length between CDI forms mean that comparisons of raw scores across instruments are inappropriate. Dividing raw scores by the total number of items on a form results in proportions, which are somewhat more comparable but still potentially misleading. A more comprehensive form with more items on it will yield lower proportions for children with the same vocabulary size. Despite this weakeness, we typically use proportions for visualizing differences across forms as it is cumbersome to compare raw scores with different totals. More discussion of absolute and relative vocabulary size differences between instruments can be found in Chapter <a href="vocab.html#vocab">3</a>.</p>
<p>Like other psychometric instruments, CDI instruments can also be normed, and many of the most popular forms are. In the standard norming process, the form is administered to a large typically-developing sample so that percentile ranks can be computed. For new administrations, the percentile of a particular raw score can be computed and used in place of the proportions or raw scores. These percentile ranks can be useful for clinical purposes, but they also complicate comparison across instruments because of potential differences in the norming population to begin with. In addition, the Wordbank dataset includes normed and un-normed forms, and for the normed forms, we sometimes have access to both the norming dataset and other data but sometimes only have access to the norming data. For these reasons, we do not employ normative percentile ranks in our analyses.</p>
<p>As the preceding discussion shows, there are serious difficulties that crop up immediately in comparisons across instruments. We will grapple with these difficulties throughout the book, but we generally adopt two approaches that help us navigate this complexity. The first approach, which is used in the majority of chapters, we describe below. The second approach is described in the next subsection.</p>
<p>In general, our approach to cross-linguistic and cross-instrument data is to provide standardized analyses within each instrument and language, without assuming equivalence across words, instruments, or populations. Thus, we will typically investigate a particular phenomenon (say the “noun bias” or the “female advantage”) independently and in parallel for each of the instruments available to us.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> We can then – still with caution – analyze and compare the magnitude of this phenomenon across languages, having abstracted away from the specifics of each particular instrument. We sometimes colloquially refer to this approach as “every form an island,” meaning that each instrument is analzyed separately and only the analytic results at the highest level are compared.</p>
</div>
<div id="unilemmas-cross-linguistic-conceptual-mappings" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.4</span> “Unilemmas”: cross-linguistic conceptual mappings</h3>
<p>Cross-linguistic conceptual comparisons are fraught, both philosophically <span class="citation">(e.g., Quine <a href="references.html#ref-quine1960">1960</a>)</span> and practically. We refer to the practical issue as the <em>tortilla</em> problem: in American English, we have the word <em>bread</em>, which translates to <em>pan</em> in Mexican Spanish. But the Spanish word <em>tortilla</em> takes some of the cultural role of <em>bread</em> in English; <em>bread</em> has two reasonable translations. These translation issues go the other way as well: <em>reloj</em> translates to two distinct words (<em>clock</em> and <em>watch</em>) in English. For this reason, we typically adopt the approach described above. But questions nevertheless arise in the course of analyzing CDI data that can only be answered by comparison across languages (see e.g., Chapter <a href="aoapred.html#aoapred">9</a>).</p>
<p>Thus, in order to facilitate (cautious) cross-linguistic comparison, we developed a set of rough-and-ready translation equivalents. We call these “unilemmas” (short for “universal lemmas”). A “lemma” is a canonical form of a word, typically used for gathering frequency counts across different morphological variants (e.g., “walk” is the lemma for “walks,” “walked,” and “walking”). Unilemmas are used for mapping distinct lexical forms across languages. Unilemmas enable a number of desirable analyses, but more practically, they also provide consistent glosses that make it easier for researchers to work in languages with which they are not familiar. For convenience, our unilemmas are written in English, but they could of course have been written in any other language as well.</p>
<p>Unilemmas were created for particular instruments by following a two-step procedure. First, using a pool of English unilemmas, we proposed candidate mappings for each lexical item on a form. This first step was often accomplished by a non-native speaker using translation resources and the context of the form (e.g., that an item occurs in the “animal sounds” section). Second, we recruited a linguistically-sophisticated native speaker of the language (often a psychologist or linguist), provided them with the candidate unilemma list, and asked them to review this list item by item and suggest corrections and amendments.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Not every instrument has unilemma mappings, but they are currently available for FIXME forms in FIXME languages.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-note-on-age" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.5</span> A note on age</h3>
<p>Developmental psychologists are very fond of using temporal units like months and years as rough guides. Children tend to begin to crawl between 5 and 8 months, and say their first word around one year. This practice is fine for rules of thumb, but we also use these units for measurement as though they were precise (e.g., “infants with ages between 7;0 and 8;0”) when in fact such infants will vary in the number of days since their birth depending on facs like whether their seven months of life encompassed February or not. A similar problem is true of years as a scientific unit – because of leap years, years technically include 365.2524 das — though the magnitude of the imprecision is smaller.</p>
<p>Despite these issues, months are the currency of language development research, and we often receive contributed datasets with months alone reported. In Wordbank, we define a <em>standardized month</em> as 365.2524 / 12 = 30.4377 days. When possible, we compute the number of days from birth to testing and then compute the number of standardized months that the child has lived. If this is not possible, we use months as reported in the dataset. We define an eight-month-old (<code>age == 8</code>) as a child who has lived between 8 and 9 standard months: their age is in the range [8 - 9) standard months. (The alternative definition, from 7;16 – 8;15, is sometimes used in infancy research but is in our opinion less intuitive.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="datasets" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Datasets</h2>
<p>This section gives a broad overview of the data we have available. Unlike projects in which data are collected by the organizers, in our work here, we rely on the kindness of others in contributing data that are often years or decades old. Some datasets come via an email containing well-curated tabular data; others were contributed in more idiosyncratic formats or even on paper. One dataset was even retrieved by one of us in the form of a paper bag full of old paper forms from a doorstep several hours drive away. Thus, the amount and type of meta-data available for some datasets is limited. For example, we have limited demographic information for some datasets and only vocabulary – not complexity or gesture – items for others. In many cases we do not have full details of instructions and administration for a particular dataset. This section gives an overview of data availability and some demographic comparisons of the samples. Specifics of each dataset – to the extent that they are available – are given in Appendix <a href="appendix-data.html#appendix-data">A</a>.</p>
<div id="data-provenance" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Data Provenance</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, datasets come from a variety of sources. In all cases, the preferred citation for each dataset and its contributor is given on the <a href="http://wordbank.stanford.edu/contributors.html">Wordbank contributors page</a>. Several of these datasets were transferred second-hand from a pre-existing database (CLEX-CDI; <span class="citation">Jørgensen et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-jorgensen2010">2010</a>)</span>), while many of the others were contributed directly via electronic or paper forms. In the case of paper forms, we rekeyed the forms using double-entry methods (either ourselves or via a commercial contractor).<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Each of these datasets is then imported to the database by creating a custom import key that matches individual columns of the dataset to particular database fields (e.g., item types like words or gestures, or standardized demographic fields). These mappings are preserved along with the raw data so that they can be re-checked later.</p>
</div>
<div id="overview-of-the-data" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Overview of the data</h3>
<p>Wordbank currently contains data from 25 language communities. Many of these are from instruments in the original Words &amp; Gestures (infant) / Words &amp; Sentences (toddler) format, with around 400 items in WG and 700 in the WS. Typically, WG forms are intended for children from 8–18 months and WS forms are intended for children 16–30 months, but these ranges are flexible.

<div id="administration-details" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.3</span> Administration details</h3>
<p>Data in the dataset were gathered between the beginning of the first CDI norming study in 1990 (FIXME; <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="virginia"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>?) and the present, with the majority of datasets gather within the 10–15 years prior to the writing of this book. The details of administration vary widely from dataset to dataset. Though we have different levels of knowledge regarding the exact details of administration, we know that the three most common circumstances of administration (in no particular order) are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>On paper in a lab or other space, with instructions given in person by a researcher (e.g., FIXME);</li>
<li>On paper, with the form sent by mail with written or telephone instructions from a researcher (e.g., the British English Twins Early Development data, which were sent home as part of a packet); or</li>
<li>Electronically, with instructions given either electronically or by phone (e.g., Norwegian, Danish, and Slovak data).</li>
</ol>
<p>We have limited direct evidence about the effects of particular administration details on the overall results, but the CDI community has amassed a substantial set of anecdotal experiences. For example, improper administration or limited instructions can result in over- or under-reporting, especially with respect to comprehension <span class="citation">(see e.g., Feldman et al. <a href="references.html#ref-feldman2000">2000</a>)</span>. For example, in one trial we conducted using electronic administration, we found that basic written instructions were misinterpreted by some proportion of parents (as evinced by an atypical number of floor and ceiling responses). This proportion appeared to decrease when we made an attempt to simplify and illustrate the instructions that we gave. Such experiences suggest – congruent with the general warnings above – that caution is warranted in interpreting absolute comparisons between different populations where there are also differences in administration style.</p>
</div>
<div id="demographics" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.4</span> Demographics</h3>
<p>In addition to differences in administration and form, samples from different studies also differ in myriad other ways. The most important of these, especially cultural differences between language communities, are extremely hard to quantify. But we can make a first stab at investigating some similarities and differences between the convenience samples from different studies by comparing demographics where they are available.</p>
<p><img src="wordbank-book_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /> Sex proportions tend to be quite close to .5, with a few exceptions for small datasets. Several WG datasets (e.g., British Sign Language, Russian, Italian, Quebec French) have more males than would be expected by chance. This pattern is important because (as we will investigate in Chapter <a href="methods.html#demographics">2.2.4</a>), there are systematic differences in vocabulary size between boys and girls, and so sample differences in gender will lead to absolute differences in mean vocabulary size.</p>
<p><img src="wordbank-book_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /> Although we have maternal education data for far fewer datasets, there are also substantial differences between datasets on this variable (we will also return to this issue again in Chapter <a href="methods.html#demographics">2.2.4</a>). Analyses of this variable are complicated by different reporting formats, so for example the German and Mexican Spanish datasets have no separate categorization for graduate education. That said, even for datasets with the most fine-grained maternal education breakdown, we see substantial differences.</p>
<p><img src="wordbank-book_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Finally, when we examine birth order, we also see differences in the proportion of children who are first- vs. later-born. The majority of the German sample is first-born, while the Czech sample has many more second children, for example.</p>
<p>In summary, our samples differ substantially in their demographic makeup. Presumably these differences are due both to the composition of the societies being sampled as well as the sampling procedure the researchers used.</p>
</div>
<div id="longitudinal-vs.cross-sectional-data" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.5</span> Longitudinal vs. cross-sectional data</h3>
<p>The strongest developmental inferences can be made by the examination of longitudinal data, in which children’s individual development is measured multiple times using the same instrument. Unfortunately, relatively little of our CDI data comes from this type of repeated administration and so we must typically settle for using the large amount of available cross-sectional data to average out individual variability.</p>
<p><img src="wordbank-book_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /> ### Conclusions</p>
<p>The strength of the Wordbank framework is that it allow access to CDI data in a consistent format, such that analyses can be applied uniformly. Yet we must not allow this ease to blind us to the difficulties of comparing across measurements that are gathered using different forms, under different administration conditions, and from convenience samples in different countries and cultures using different sampling schemes. Each of these differences has the potential to complicate cross-linguistic comparisons. We will return to each again and again throughout the book.</p>

For cases when there are two equally good English words, put both.
