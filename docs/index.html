<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Preface</h1>
<p>How do children learn their first language? Despite the importance of this question, establishing the mechanisms of early language acquisition has been difficult. Early language learning involves the accumulation of thousands of words, grammatical rules, and constructions, and takes place over the course of years of growth and millions of separate interactions. Further complicating the study of this process is the fact that, during the period in which language emerges, language ability varies wildly from child to child and most children are at best reluctant experimental participants. These two observations mean that accurate measurement of language development across individuals is a major challenge.</p>
<p>Parent report is one powerful method for investigating. The MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CDI) is a simple survey instrument for measuring early language outcomes that was designed to address these issues.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The CDI is a checklist for parents to fill out to report on their child’s progress in language. In different versions of the form, parents mark whether their child “says” or “says and understands” particular words out of a list of several hundred. Separate sections for gestures, word forms, and grammar are also present in some versions. Despite their simplicity, over the past 25 years of use, CDI forms have been shown to be reliable and valid measures of children’s early language. In addition, CDI forms have been adapted to more than 60 different languages around the world. Research based on the CDI has contributed tremendously to our understanding of the growth of language in early childhood.</p>
<p>In this book, we examine the question of variability and consistency in early language through the lens of the CDI. This book is a product of the Wordbank project <span class="citation">(Frank et al. <a href="references.html#ref-frank2016">2016</a>)</span>, a project deovted to archiving CDI data in a structured format so that it can be explored and analyzed in the service of describing vocabulary acquisition. The database currently contains data from more than 70198 CDI form administrations across <code>length(unique(instruments$language))</code> languages. Wordbank is also continuously growing as new researchers contribute data. We believe this database is the largest and most diverse set of data on early language acquisition currently in existence.</p>
<p>Over the course of our work with Wordbank, we have developed a consistent framework for representing and analyzing CDI data. This framework is statistically well-grounded and allows us to unify a variety of influential previous analyses of CDI data. Just to take an example, one question of theoretical interest has been whether young children have an over-representation of nouns (names for things) in their vocabulary, and whether this trend is seen across languages. In Chapter <a href="#categories"><strong>??</strong></a> , we develop an analytic method for measuring the size of this “noun bias” across languages and applied the analysis across all of the languages in Wordbank at the time. The result supports two generalizations that –- we believe -– clarify the situation in this previously-controversial field: 1) nouns are over-represented in most languages, but 2) East Asian languages do (as claimed) show far less noun bias. Our hope is that these findings will provide a baseline for future work.</p>
<p>More generally, our intent is to contribute to the literature by synthesizing previous work. Research in early language learning often builds off a fragmentary empirical picture, in which many important theoretical conclusions are based on analyses of transcripts from a small number of children, or analyses of data from English learners. We hope that bringing together a large set of analyses of vocabulary data and implementing them consistently, openly, and reproducibly on the same dataset will help to create an empirical starting-point for future work.</p>
<p>On the theoretical side, we develop the notion of “process universals” -– that aspects of the process of word learning may be universal across cultures and may lead to similarities in the dynamics of learning. These universals may arise due to the basic mechanisms of learning, memory, and social cognition that are at play in early vocabulary learning. This notion of process universals has a long history in the field (by Bates, Slobin and others), but the Wordbank project provides an opportunity to lend new empirical data and analytic power to these ideas. This notion is contrasted with notions of “content” or “structural” universals in which particular principles regarding the structure of languages are innately given.</p>
