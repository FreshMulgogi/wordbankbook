<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>How do children learn their first language? Despite the importance of this question, establishing the mechanisms of early language acquisition has been difficult. Early language learning involves the accumulation of thousands of words, grammatical rules, and constructions, and takes place over the course of years of growth and millions of separate interactions. Further complicating the study of this process is the fact that, during the period in which language emerges, language ability varies wildly from child to child and most children are at best reluctant experimental participants. These two observations mean that accurate measurement of language development across individuals is a major challenge.</p>
<p>Parent report is one powerful method for investigating this development. The MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CDI) is a simple survey instrument for measuring early language outcomes that was designed to address these issues.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The CDI is a checklist for parents to fill out to report on their child’s progress in language. In different versions of the form, parents mark whether their child “says” or “says and understands” particular words out of a list of several hundred. Separate sections for gestures, word forms, and grammar are also present in some versions. Despite their simplicity, over the past 25 years of use, CDI forms have been shown to be reliable and valid measures of children’s early language. In addition, CDI forms have been adapted to more than 60 different languages around the world. Research based on the CDI has contributed tremendously to our understanding of the growth of language in early childhood.</p>
<p>In this book, we examine the question of variability and consistency in early language through the lens of the CDI. This book is a product of the Wordbank project <span class="citation">(M. C. Frank et al. <a href="appendix-aoa.html#ref-frank2016">2016</a>)</span>, a project devoted to archiving CDI data in a structured format so that it can be explored and analyzed in the service of describing vocabulary acquisition. The database currently contains data from more than 71933 CDI form administrations across 25 languages. Wordbank is also continuously growing as new researchers contribute data. We believe this database is the largest and most diverse set of data on early language acquisition currently in existence.</p>
<p>Over the course of our work with Wordbank, we have developed a consistent framework for representing and analyzing CDI data. This framework is statistically well-grounded and allows us to unify a variety of influential previous analyses of CDI data. Just to take an example, one question of theoretical interest has been whether young children have an over-representation of nouns (names for things) in their vocabulary, and whether this trend is seen across languages. In Chapter <a href="categories.html#categories">5</a>, we develop an analytic method for measuring the size of this “noun bias” across languages and applied the analysis across all of the languages in Wordbank at the time. The result supports two generalizations that – we believe – clarify the situation in this previously-controversial field: 1) nouns are over-represented in most languages, but 2) East Asian languages do (as claimed) show far less noun bias. Our hope is that these findings will provide a baseline for future work.</p>
<p>More generally, our intent is to contribute to the literature by synthesizing previous work. Research in early language learning often builds off a fragmentary empirical picture, in which many important theoretical conclusions are based on analyses of transcripts from a small number of children, or analyses of data from English learners. We hope that bringing together a large set of analyses of vocabulary data and implementing them consistently, openly, and reproducibly on the same dataset will help to create an empirical starting-point for future work.</p>
<p>On the theoretical side, we develop the notion of “process universals” – that aspects of the process of word learning may be universal across cultures and may lead to similarities in the dynamics of learning. These universals may arise due to the basic mechanisms of learning, memory, and social cognition that are at play in early vocabulary learning. This notion of process universals has a long history in the field (by Bates, Slobin and others), but the Wordbank project provides an opportunity to lend new empirical data and analytic power to these ideas. This notion is contrasted with notions of “content” or “structural” universals in which particular principles regarding the structure of languages are innately given.</p>

<h2>Outline of the Book</h2>
<p>Although our goal is a full exploration of the phenomena of child language acquisition, the analyses we report are constrained by the structure of the data in Wordbank. At its heart, the individual instrument datasets stored in Wordbank are matrices of item x child data. Considering the data in this way (shown in Figure @ref(1_outline_diagram)), leads to a number of obvious data analytic strategies, many of which correspond directly to previous approaches to CDI data.</p>

<p>For example, averaging across items leads to <em>by-child averages</em>, where each child receives a comprehension or production score. Chapter <a href="vocab.html#vocab">3</a> considers this view of the data, examining predictors of individual children’s vocabulary. Of course, chief among these is age, and developmental growth patterns as well as variability in development is considered in the first part of this chapter. But beyond age, even the limited demographic data available in Wordbank can be used to explore the data; we report the ways that vocabulary growth varies across gender, birth order, and maternal education (a rough but cross-cultually valid proxy for socio-economic status). These demographic predictors reveal both consistent and variable patterns across languages: while gender and birth-order effects are relatively constant, socio-economic effects vary widely in magnitude.</p>
<p>Averaging across the other margin of the data leads to <em>by-item averages</em>. These can be examined in a number of different ways. First, items can be grouped into categories (both syntactic and semantic). Chapter <a href="categories.html#categories">5</a> considers the categorical composition of early vocabulary, giving special consideration to the “noun bias” that is found in many – but not all – of the languages in Wordbank. Chapter <a href="items.html#items">7</a> considers the growth trajectories for individual words and adopts the approach of predicting the trajectories of individual words based on both environmental and conceptual features of these words. This approach calls for the incorporation of other resources, and so we use a variety of English and cross-linguistic resources to supplement Wordbank data in this chapter.</p>
<p>Not all items denote individual words, however, so in Chapters <a href="gestures.html#gestures">10</a> and <a href="grammar.html#grammar">11</a>, we consider the gesture/communication and grammatical items that are included in some CDI forms. Chapter <a href="gestures.html#gestures">10</a> follows up on the early work of <span class="citation">Fenson et al. (<a href="appendix-aoa.html#ref-fenson1994">1994</a>)</span> who explored the relationship between gesture and early vocabulary. Chapter <a href="grammar.html#grammar">11</a> explores the work of <span class="citation">Bates and Goodman (<a href="appendix-aoa.html#ref-bates1999">1999</a>)</span> and <span class="citation">Marchman and Bates (<a href="appendix-aoa.html#ref-marchman1994">1994</a>)</span>, who considered the relationship between vocabulary growth and the growth of grammar and first reported the striking relationship between these variables. Both of these chapters (as well as the rest of the book) are deeply indebted to the Batesian vision of exploring the process of language learning.</p>

<div id="how-to-read-this-book" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>How to Read This Book</h2>
<p>You can read as a narrative monograph. If you do so, we recommend you look at Practical Foundations and Methods before moving on to substantive chapters of interest. We also recommend you read our theoretical synthesis in the Conclusions chapter.</p>
<p>You can read as a reference book. If you take this approach, just dive into any chapter that is of interest, knowing that you may need to use some of the terminology defined in the Methods chapter to interpret the constructs and analysess that are used.</p>
<p>Many of the analyses reported here were first described in earlier publications <span class="citation">(e.g., M. C. Frank et al. <a href="appendix-aoa.html#ref-frank2016">2016</a>,<span class="citation">M. Braginsky et al. (<a href="appendix-aoa.html#ref-braginsky2015">2015</a>)</span>,<span class="citation">Braginsky et al. (n.d.)</span>)</span>. Rather than reprinting these, this manuscript updates them using the unified analytic approach and larger dataset described in Chapter <a href="methods.html#methods">2</a>. The version of these analyses represented in the manuscript should be considered more definitive than any previously published or presented version.</p>

<div id="static-book-dynamic-data" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Static Book, Dynamic Data</h2>
<p>The dataset in Wordbank is constantly growing and changing as we add new features, new data, and new languages. In addition, as users of the data occasionally identify issues and errors, we make will make corrections to the database. In writing this manuscript, we have attempted to find a middle ground between a completely dynamic document that responds to any change in the database on the one hand and a traditional, static book on the other. A static manuscript would be a shame given the potential for dynamic extension and updating with new data. On the other hand, if the data were completely dynamic, any claim we made in prose would risk being out of date almost as soon as we wrote it.</p>
<p>For this reason, we work using snapshots of the underlying database. Every so often, we will return to the manuscript and recompile the online edition, then check references to the data that might have changed. This build of the book is based on FIXME DATE.</p>
