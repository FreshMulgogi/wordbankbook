=======
<p>Which words do children learn first? In spite of tremendous individual variation in rate of development (1), the first words that children utter are strikingly consistent <span class="citation">(Tardif et al. <a href="appendix-variability.html#ref-tardif2008">2008</a>)</span>: they tend to talk about important people in their life (“mom”, “dad”), social routines (“hi”, “uh oh”), animals (“dog”, “duck”), and foods (“milk”, “banana”). As children learn from their experiences and according to their own interests <span class="citation">(Mayor and Plunkett <a href="appendix-variability.html#ref-mayor2014">2014</a>)</span> their vocabulary grows rapidly, typically adding more nouns, but also verbs (“go”) and other predicates (“hot”) to their production repertoires. In the latter part of this chapter, we ask <em>why</em> some words are learned before others. But first, we ask the prior question: How similar are the acquisition trajectories of children learning different languages? Similar trajectories–no matter their proximal causes–suggest that these causes are consistent across languages.</p>
<p>Because the CDIs are adaptations and not translations, the individual item inventories vary significantly across languages. Nonetheless, when translation equivalents exist on multiple forms we can look at the variability in how quickly they are acquired across languages.</p>

<p>Demographic effects. In this part, we focus on demographic differences in the learning of individual words. Braginsky et al. (2016b) reported on gender differences in the particular words in early vocabulary; we generalize this analysis to birth order and socio-economic status</p>

<p>AOA PRED</p>
<p>Predicting early learning. Braginsky et al. (2016a) provides an analysis in which independent data sources (including transcripts of child-directed speech) are brought to bear as predictors of acquisition differences between words. This “age of acquisition prediction” model allows us to quantify the consistency and variability in predictor values across languages for particular words, using the UL approach to cross-linguistic analysis.</p>
<p>By-item stuff like overall item trajectories, <code>gender-input</code>, and <code>uni_lemma</code> based cross-linguistic consistency things.</p>
