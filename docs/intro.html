<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Some material in this chapter comes from <span class="citation">Frank et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-frank2016">2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The emergence of children’s early language is one of the most miraculous parts of human development. The ability to communicate using language arrives with incredible rapidity – most parents judge that their child is producing words with the intent to communicate before his or her first word before their first birthday <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="schneider2015"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> and now several reports indicate that the onset of comprehension is even earlier <span class="citation">(e.g., <span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="bergelson2012"><strong>???</strong></span>,<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="tincoff2005"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>)</span>. Yet the path towards linguistic mastery is slow</p>
<p>Almost uniquely in cognitive development, early language learning also offers an opportunity to study both consistency and variability in a single phenomenon. Often researchers interested in consistency have measured theoretically-important, carefully chosen phenomena using small convenience samples that suffice to show a proof-of-concept but do not provide information about variability. In contrast, work on variability between individuals has often focused on larger samples with more reliable tasks, that – perhaps as a consequence of their reliability – are less tightly linked to a particular theoretical construct of interest.</p>
<p>The nature and course of early word learning is an important window into children’s growing understanding of the world. Early words cross-cut a variety of linguistic categories, but generally consist of names for caregivers (e.g., mama), common objects (e.g., bottle, shoe), social expressions (e.g., bye-bye), and actions or routines (e.g., peekaboo, throw) . New words enter children’s expressive vocabularies slowly at first, but this process accelerates over the second year such that children reach an average of 300 words by 24 months and more than 60,000 by the time they graduate from high school . At the same time, there are significant individual differences in language acquisition. For example, according to detailed observational studies, although some 18-month-olds already produce 50–75 words, others produce no words at all, and will not do so until they are 22 months or older &lt;e.g.,&gt;{brown1973,bloom2002,clark2003}. How can such differences be measured accurately and efficiently? And can we promote early detection of differences in vocabulary growth that will be clinically significant later in development?</p>

<div id="measuring-early-vocabulary" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Measuring early vocabulary</h3>
<p>Traditional studies of language development typically apply a combination of observational assessment and structured tests, frequently relying on short samples of interactions and small samples of children. Discerning both the universal features and natural variation of early lexical development has been greatly facilitated by the development of parent report instruments like the MacArthur-Bates CDI <span class="citation">(L. Fenson et al. <a href="references.html#ref-fenson1994">1994</a>; Larry Fenson et al. <a href="references.html#ref-fenson2007">2007</a>)</span> and the Language Development Survey <span class="citation">(LDS; Rescorla <a href="references.html#ref-rescorla1989">1989</a>)</span>. The CDIs in particular were developed across a period of more than 40 years. Originally designed for use in a research study <span class="citation">(E. Bates <a href="references.html#ref-bates1976">1976</a>)</span>, the instruments have evolved from a structured interview to the current paper-and-pencil format and are now increasingly administered online <span class="citation">(e.g., Kristoffersen et al. <a href="references.html#ref-kristoffersen2013">2013</a>)</span> for Norwegian or  for Slovak). While other assessment tools exist for slightly older children, to our knowledge, no other measure allows cost-effective global language assessment for children in the critical age ranges between the emergence of language and the period when children become more able to engage in structured, face-to-face activities (around 30 months).</p>
<p>Naturalistic observations are the other leading candidate for measurement of early language, but such observations are extremely costly and time-consuming to transcribe and annotate. These difficulties lead to a tradeoff where most studies either include dense data about a small number of children or smaller amounts of data with a larger sample size. Dense datasets currently provide the best method for in-depth study of the interaction between learning mechanisms and language input in individuals <span class="citation">(e.g., Lieven, Salomo, and Tomasello <a href="references.html#ref-lieven2009">2009</a>; B. C. Roy et al. <a href="references.html#ref-roy2015">2015</a>)</span>, although the generality of these studies is necessarily limited by their small sample sizes. At the other end of the spectrum, assessment of many individual language samples can yield information about individual variability [e.g., dickinson2001,cartmill2013,weisleder2013], but at some cost in terms of depth.</p>
<p>In addition, naturalistic observations do not measure children’s language comprehension, a variable of interest for many early language researchers. Estimates of production vocabulary from naturalistic observation are highly correlated with the CDI within studies [e.g., bornstein1998], but are likely to be affected substantially by length of the session, context, and interlocutor when comparing across studies <span class="citation">(see e.g., Hidaka <a href="references.html#ref-hidaka2015">2015</a> for discussion)</span>. And although there exist methods to extract insights about global vocabulary from naturalistic observation, these statistical extrapolations are relatively new and have not been validated extensively <span class="citation">(Hidaka <a href="references.html#ref-hidaka2015">2015</a>)</span>. Other comprehension vocabulary measures are also available across some range of languages <span class="citation">(e.g., the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test 4; L. M. Dunn and Dunn <a href="references.html#ref-dunn2007">2007</a>)</span>, but these assessments are tailored for substantially older children.</p>
<p>Parent-report measures like the CDI and LDS take advantage of the fact that parents are expert observers of their child. CDI instruments ask about use of communicative gestures, grammar, and symbolic play, as well as vocabulary, which is measured using checklists consisting of representative samples of words. Parents choose the words their child currently <code>understands'' (comprehension, measured for younger children) or</code>says’’ (production, measured for both younger and older children). The checklists contain words from many different semantic (e.g., animal names, household items) and syntactic (e.g., action words, connectives) categories, resulting in broader samples of lexical knowledge than are available from other methods. In their English and Spanish instantiations, the instruments come in two versions: Words &amp; Gestures (8–18 months) and Words &amp; Sentences (16–30 months). Originally designed for English, parallel instruments have now been adapted for more than 60 languages <span class="citation">(P. S. Dale and Penfold <a href="references.html#ref-dale2011">2011</a>)</span>.</p>

<div id="limitations-of-parent-report" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> Limitations of parent report</h3>
<p>Although the standardization of parent reports using the CDI contributes to the availability of large amounts of data in a comparable format, there are significant limitations to the parent report methodology as well . First, parents may be biased observers; some may overestimate, while others likely underestimate their children’s abilities. There is also some evidence that some variability may be due to reporting biases linked to factors such as SES . Second, parent reports of comprehension for younger children likely suffer from a number of biases and are probably substantially more accurate for content words than function words. Third, the items on the original CDI instruments were chosen to be a representative sample of vocabulary for the appropriate age and language , not with the intention that they would be a complete set of words that could be compared across instruments or that they would be individually reliable and license the conclusion that a particular child knows a particular word. Fourth, although the length of the CDI may give the impression that it yields an estimate of the child’s full vocabulary, in fact it likely understates the size of a child’s vocabulary substantially, especially for older children .</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, when used appropriately the CDI instruments are still an important tool. The instruments were designed to minimize bias by targeting current behaviors and asking parents about highly salient features of their child’s abilities. They yield reliable and valid estimates of total vocabulary size, with dozens of studies demonstrating concurrent and predictive relations with naturalistic and observational measures, in both typically-developing and at-risk populations <span class="citation">(e.g., P. S. Dale and Fenson <a href="references.html#ref-dale1996">1996</a>; D. Thal, Jackson-Maldonado, and Acosta <a href="references.html#ref-thal2000">2000</a>; Marchman and Martínez-Sussmann <a href="references.html#ref-marchman2002">2002</a>)</span>. In addition, a variety of recent work has shown that individual item-level responses can yield exciting new insights, for example about the growth patterns of semantic networks [<span class="citation">Hills et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-hills2009">2009</a>)</span>;hills2010]. Such analyses have the potential to be even more powerful when applied to larger samples and across languages.</p>

<div id="wordbank" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.3</span> Wordbank</h3>
<p>To take advantage of the opportunity posed by the broad use of CDI instruments in the child language community, in 2014 we began constructing Wordbank, an open repository for CDI data that allows for interactive analysis and visualization. Our inspiration for Wordbank came from two successful projects for sharing data on children’s language acquisition. The first is the Child Language Data Exchange System <span class="citation">(CHILDES; MacWhinney <a href="references.html#ref-macwhinney2000">2000</a>)</span>. A database of transcripts of children’s speech and speech to children, CHILDES has grown into a robust and important tool for the community, with many contributors and affiliated projects. The second is the Cross-Linguistic Lexical Norms site <span class="citation">(CLEX; ; R. N. Jørgensen et al. <a href="references.html#ref-jorgensen2010">2010</a>})</span>, which is closer in content to Wordbank, and effectively our precursor. CLEX archives normative data from a range of CDI adaptations across languages, allowing browsing of acquisition trajectories for individual items or age groups.</p>
<p>Wordbank builds on CLEX, offering the same functionality but allowing flexible and interactive visualization and analysis, as well as direct database access and data download. In addition, Wordbank’s goal was always toextend beyond normative data by dynamically incorporating data from many different researchers and projects of varying sizes and scopes. While the resulting datasets in Wordbank are much more heterogeneous than norming data, they are also larger and more representative than the individual norming datasets (in some cases), and available in languages where no norms exist (for others).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Theoretical Foundations: Theories of Language Acquisition</h2>
<p>There are many approaches to studying language learning. We distinguish a couple of major touchstones theories so that we can refer back to them.</p>
<p>Theories of vocabulary acquisition:</p>

<li>Cross-situational Learning <span class="citation">(Yu and Ballard <a href="references.html#ref-yu2007">2007</a>)</span></li>

</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-of-the-book" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Outline of the Book</h2>
<p>Our analyses are organized by different ways of cutting our data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vocabulary: total numbers of words said or understood by individuals, examined via demographic and longitudinal methods.</li>
<li>Word categories: What word categories are learned earlier or later? How do these patterns vary across languages?</li>
<li>Individual words: What words are learned earlier or later? Are there demographic or category differences in words?</li>
<li>Grammatical items: How does grammatical complexity change across development? How is it related to the growth of the lexicon?</li>
<li>Gesture items: How does gesture relate to early language?</li>
</ul>
<p>But, we also discuss cross-cutting theoretical themes for each analysis.</p>
