<p>The emergence of children’s early language is one of the most miraculous parts of human development. The ability to communicate using language arrives with incredible rapidity – most parents judge that their child is producing words with the intent to communicate before his or her first birthday <span class="citation">(Schneider, Yurovsky, and Frank <a href="references.html#ref-schneider2015">2015</a>)</span> and the onset of comprehension is even earlier <span class="citation">(e.g., Bergelson and Swingley <a href="references.html#ref-bergelson2012">2012</a>; Tincoff and Jusczyk <a href="references.html#ref-tincoff1999">1999</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>New words enter children’s expressive vocabularies slowly at first, but this process accelerates over the second year such that children reach an average of 300 words by 24 months and more than 60,000 by the time they graduate from high school <span class="citation">(L. Fenson et al. <a href="references.html#ref-fenson2007">2007</a>)</span>. At the same time, there are significant individual differences in the rate and timing of language acquisition. For example, according to detailed observational studies, although some 18-month-olds already produce 50–75 words, others produce no words at all, and will not do so until they are 22 months or older <span class="citation">(e.g., Brown <a href="references.html#ref-brown1973">1973</a>; P. Bloom <a href="references.html#ref-bloom2002">2002</a>; E. Clark <a href="references.html#ref-clark2003">2003</a>)</span>. Moreover, some children show increases in their rate of vocabulary growth well before the end of the 2nd year, others not until well after their 2nd birthday, and still others may not “spurt” at all <span class="citation">(L. Fenson et al. <a href="references.html#ref-fenson2007">2007</a>; Goldfield and Reznick <a href="references.html#ref-goldfield1990">1990</a>; Ganger and Brent <a href="references.html#ref-ganger2004">2004</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Almost uniquely in cognitive development, early language learning also offers an opportunity to study both consistency and variability in a single phenomenon. Often researchers interested in consistency have measured theoretically-important, carefully-chosen phenomena using small convenience samples that suffice to show a proof-of-concept but do not provide information about variability. In contrast, work on variability between individuals has often focused on larger samples with more reliable tasks, that – perhaps as a consequence of their reliability – are less tightly linked to a particular theoretical construct of interest. And these constructs may depart from the ecological task that is of principal interest <span class="citation">(Cronbach and Meehl <a href="references.html#ref-cronbach1955">1955</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Early language is a rare case where these problems are minimized. Measures of early language comprehension and production tend to be face valid and tightly linked to the construct of interest in their structure. And yet, in contrast to the measures that usually fulfill these criteria, early language measures are very closely related to the ecological task – linguistic communication – that is the theoretical target for explanation. Thus, early language is the rare case where consistency and variability can both be explored in a single set of measurements <span class="citation">(Bates et al. <a href="references.html#ref-bates1994">1994</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Further, the nature and course of early word learning is an important window into children’s growing understanding of the world – beyond language. Early words cross-cut a variety of linguistic categories, but generally consist of names for caregivers (e.g., mama), common objects (e.g., bottle, shoe), social expressions (e.g., bye-bye), and actions or routines (e.g., peekaboo, throw) <span class="citation">(Nelson <a href="references.html#ref-nelson1973">1973</a>; Tardif et al. <a href="references.html#ref-tardif2008">2008</a>)</span>. Yet this repertoire expands, and its composition can give insights into the learning mechanisms, biases, and priorities of young children.</p>
<div id="measuring-early-vocabulary" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Measuring early vocabulary</h2>
<p>Traditional studies of language development typically apply a combination of observational assessment and structured tests, frequently relying on short samples of interactions and small samples of children. Discerning both the universal features and natural variation of early lexical development has been greatly facilitated by the development of parent report instruments like the MacArthur-Bates CDI <span class="citation">(L. Fenson et al. <a href="references.html#ref-fenson1994">1994</a>; L. Fenson et al. <a href="references.html#ref-fenson2007">2007</a>)</span> and the Language Development Survey <span class="citation">(LDS; Rescorla <a href="references.html#ref-rescorla1989">1989</a>)</span>. The CDIs in particular were developed across a period of more than 40 years. Originally designed for use in a research study <span class="citation">(Bates <a href="references.html#ref-bates1976">1976</a>)</span>, the instruments have evolved from a structured interview to the current paper-and-pencil format and are now increasingly administered online [e.g., the <a href="http://web-cdi.stanford.edu">web-cdi project</a>; <span class="citation">Kristoffersen et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-kristoffersen2013">2013</a>)</span> for Norwegian;  for Slovak]. While other assessment tools exist for slightly older children, to our knowledge, no other measure allows cost-effective global language assessment for children in the critical age ranges between the emergence of language and the period when children become more able to engage in structured, face-to-face activities (around 30 months).</p>
<p>Naturalistic observations are the other leading candidate for measurement of early language, but such observations are extremely costly and time-consuming to transcribe and annotate. These difficulties lead to a tradeoff where most studies either include dense data about a small number of children or smaller amounts of data with a larger sample size. Dense datasets currently provide the best method for in-depth study of the interaction between learning mechanisms and language input in individuals <span class="citation">(e.g., E. Lieven, Salomo, and Tomasello <a href="references.html#ref-lieven2009">2009</a>; B. C. Roy et al. <a href="references.html#ref-roy2015">2015</a>)</span>. The generalizability of these studies is necessarily limited by their small sample sizes, and sample sizes are in turn limited by the costs and practicality of gathering and transcribing such data <span class="citation">(see e.g., Bergelson and Aslin <a href="references.html#ref-bergelson2017">2017</a> for the state of the art)</span>. At the other end of the spectrum, assessment of many individual language samples can yield information about individual variability <span class="citation">(e.g., Dickinson and Tabors <a href="references.html#ref-dickinson2001">2001</a>; Cartmill et al. <a href="references.html#ref-cartmill2013">2013</a>; Weisleder and Fernald <a href="references.html#ref-weisleder2013">2013</a>)</span>, but at some cost in terms of depth.</p>
<p>In addition, naturalistic observations do not measure children’s language comprehension, a variable of interest for many early language researchers. Estimates of production vocabulary from naturalistic observation are highly correlated with the CDI within studies <span class="citation">(e.g., Bornstein and Haynes <a href="references.html#ref-bornstein1998">1998</a>)</span>, but are likely to be affected substantially by length of the session, context, and interlocutor when comparing across studies <span class="citation">(see e.g., Hidaka <a href="references.html#ref-hidaka2015">2015</a> for discussion)</span>. And although there exist methods to extract insights about global vocabulary from naturalistic observation, these statistical extrapolations are relatively new and have not been validated extensively <span class="citation">(Hidaka <a href="references.html#ref-hidaka2015">2015</a>)</span>. Other comprehension vocabulary measures are also available across some range of languages <span class="citation">(e.g., the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test 4; L. M. Dunn and Dunn <a href="references.html#ref-dunn2007">2007</a>)</span>, but these assessments are typically tailored for children older than 2 1/2 years. For breadth, depth, and ease of data gathering, parent report is unmatched.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-logic-of-parent-report" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> The logic of parent report</h2>
<p>Parent-report instruments like the CDI and LDS take advantage of the fact that parents (or other primary caregivers) are expert observers of their child. Parent reports are based on experiences with the child which are not only more extensive than any researcher or clinician can obtain, but are more representative of the child’s ability. Parents have experience with children at play, at meals, at bath and bedtime, at tantrums – in short, with the full range of the child’s life and therefore with the full range of language structures used in these contexts. Parents also have had opportunities to hear the child interact with other people: the other parent, grandparents, siblings, and friends. Because responses on these instruments represent an aggregation over much time and many situations, they are less influenced by factors that can mask a child’s true ability in the laboratory or clinic, such as shyness or compliance, or that can impact the validity of naturalistic sampling, such as word frequency. As <span class="citation">Bates, Bretherton, and Snyder (<a href="references.html#ref-bates1991">1991</a>)</span> point out, “parental report is likely to reflect what a child knows, whereas [a sample of] free speech reflects those forms that she is more likely to use.” (p. 57).</p>
<p>The application of parent report enables the collection of data from far larger samples of children than would be possible with standardized tests or naturalistic observation. Information from more adequate samples, especially in the form of norms, can benefit both clinical practice and research. <span class="citation">L. Fenson et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-fenson1994">1994</a>)</span>, for example, used the norming data from the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (CDIs) - a sample of 2,550 children aged 8 to 30 months - to address questions about variability in communicative development. Large samples are especially needed to provide an accurate statistical description of extreme scores, i.e., what score corresponds to the 10th percentile? What does the most advanced child (e.g., &gt; 90th percentile) look like at a given age? Research on questions such as environmental influences on language development can also benefit from large samples. Correlational research is hampered by the problem of multicollinearity: The predictor variables such as parental education, number of books in the home, family size, use of questions vs. imperatives, are likely to be intercorrelated, making it difficult to separate the effects of each of them individually. Large samples in which there is a substantial amount of non-overlapping variance are essential for addressing these questions.</p>
<p>An additional advantage of the parent-report method is that parents can also report on many different sub-components and correlates of early vocabulary development. In particular, the CDI instruments ask about use of communicative gestures, grammar, and symbolic play, as well as vocabulary comprehension and production. Information about what early vocabulary development correlates with, and what it does not, can yield important theoretical information about the common mechanisms underlying learning. As <span class="citation">Bates, Bretherton, and Snyder (<a href="references.html#ref-bates1991">1991</a>)</span> note, studies which have the power and scope to examine what “hangs together” across early language development can provide critical clues to how the system is put together in the first place (p. 7).</p>
<p>The main core of the CDIs is the vocabulary checklist. This list is essentially a “bag of words” which represents the set of words that best capture variation in lexical development across the full spectrum of child ages and abilities. Parents choose the words their child currently “understands” (comprehension, measured for younger children) or “says” (production, measured for both younger and older children). A child’s score on a vocabulary checklist represents their comprehension or production “vocabulary size,” indexing that child’s relative status against other children assessed with the same list.</p>
<p>The checklists contain words from many different semantic (e.g., animal names, household items) and syntactic (e.g., action words, connectives) categories, resulting in broader samples of lexical knowledge than are available from other methods. Importantly, however, these words are not chosen to create a complete list of words known by many child. Instead, CDI word lists are constructed to include a group of words that most children will know as well as a sampling of intermediate and more difficult words that will be useful in assessing variability between children. (We discuss the issue of “total vocabulary” further in Appendix <a href="appendix-vocab-estimation.html#appendix-vocab-estimation">F</a>.)</p>
<p>In their English and Spanish instantiations, the vocabulary checklists come in two versions: Words &amp; Gestures (W&amp;G) (8–18 months) which contains about 400 words, and the Words &amp; Sentences (W&amp;S) (16–30 months), which contains about 700 words. This structure has often been replicated across cross-linguistic adaptations, though there is some variation in form construction (see below), and some forms include substantially different numbers of words or include/exclude other measures.</p>
</div>
<div id="limitations-of-parent-report" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Limitations of parent report</h2>
<p>Although the standardization of parent reports using the CDI contributes to the availability of large amounts of data in a comparable format, there are significant limitations to the parent report methodology as well <span class="citation">(Tomasello and Mervis <a href="references.html#ref-tomasello1994">1994</a>, <span class="citation">Feldman et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-feldman2000">2000</a>)</span>)</span>. Clearly there are legitimate concerns about the ability of parents to provide detailed and specific knowledge about their children’s language.</p>
<p>What does it mean when a parent reports that their child knows a word? In an ideal world, parental report would be an unbiased reflection of their observation of their child’s language development: When asked if their child produces the word <em>dog</em>, a parent would try to recall situations in which their child has used the word <em>dog</em> correctly, and report the success or failure of this process of recollection. There are, however, a number of other sources of information that the parent might bring to bear. The figure below uses graphical model notation to depict information that could be reflected in parent report <span class="citation">(Jordan <a href="references.html#ref-jordan2004">2004</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>The nodes in this model reflect variables of interest – shaded gray if they are observed, and hollow if they are latent variables that the parent does not have direct access. The edges in this graph represent statistical dependencies among these variables. For each word on the CDI, the parent is asked to report <span class="math inline">\(O_{c}\)</span>: have they observed their child producing the word? This observed variable depends on a latent variable <span class="math inline">\(K_{c}\)</span>: whether their child knows the meaning of this word. This knowledge in turn depends in three other variables: <span class="math inline">\(O_{p}\)</span>, the parent’s productions of this word in the past; <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, the difficulty of learning this word; and <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{c}\)</span>, the child’s general linguistic ability. This general ability in turn depends on the parent’s linguistic ability <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{p}\)</span> and age-related factors <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{c}\)</span>. In addition, the CDI does not ask about every word in the child’s vocabulary, only items on the form <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. Because all of these other variables are statistically related to the child’s observed productions, parents could be be bringing any or all of them to bear in their responses.</p>
<p>First, parents may be biased observers generally. Most parents do not have specialized training in language development, and may not be sensitive to subtle aspects of language structure and use. Further, a natural pride in the child and a failure to critically test their impressions may cause parents to overestimate the child’s ability (<span class="math inline">\(\mu_{c}\)</span>); conversely, frustration in the case of delayed language may lead to underestimates. Parent report is most likely to be accurate under three general conditions: (1) when assessment is limited to current behaviors, (2) when assessment is focused on emergent behaviors, and (3) when a primarily recognition format is used. Each of these conditions acts to reduce demands on the respondent’s memory, for example, parents are better able to report on their child’s language at the present than at times past and when their child is actively learning the particular words on the list (e.g., names for animals).</p>
<p>Second, parent reports likely suffer from a number of biases that interact with sub-portions of the forms and the ages of the target children. For example, it is likely that parents may have more difficulty reporting on children’s comprehension or production of function words (e.g., <em>so</em>, <em>then</em>, <em>if</em>) than content words (e.g., <em>baby</em>, <em>house</em>)–relying more on their estimates of the words general difficulty (<span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>). Moreover, in typically-developing samples, parents can track their child’s receptive vocabulary to about 16-18 months, after which it is too large to monitor. Expressive vocabulary can be monitored until about 2.5 - 3 years, after which the number of words a child can say becomes too large.</p>
<p>The CDI instruments capitalize on the greater ease of recognition, as contrasted with recall, to help offset these memory limitations. That is, it is better to ask parents to report on their child’s vocabulary by selecting words from a list of possible words rather than having them write down all the words they can recall hearing their child use (or, even worse, asking the global question: “Does your child know at least 50 words?”). In addition, asking parents to reflect on their child’s language abilities may be particularly difficult for early comprehension. As <span class="citation">Tomasello and Mervis (<a href="references.html#ref-tomasello1994">1994</a>)</span> point out, for the youngest children, especially 8 - 10 month olds, vocabulary comprehension scores can be surprisingly high and likely implausible, possibly reflecting a lack of clarity in what the term “understands” means for parents of children at this young age.</p>
<p>Third, there is some evidence that variability in reporting biases may be moderated by factors such as SES <span class="citation">(Feldman et al. <a href="references.html#ref-feldman2000">2000</a>; L. Fenson et al. <a href="references.html#ref-fenson2000">2000</a>; Feldman et al. <a href="references.html#ref-feldman2005">2005</a>)</span>. Some studies suggest that parents from some SES groups may be more likely to underestimate child’s abilities <span class="citation">(Roberts, Burchinal, and Durham <a href="references.html#ref-roberts1999">1999</a>)</span>, while others report that parents from lower-SES groups may over-estimate children’s abilities, especially comprehension at younger ages [<span class="citation">Goldfield and Reznick (<a href="references.html#ref-goldfield1990">1990</a>)</span>; <span class="citation">Feldman et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-feldman2000">2000</a>)</span>). Later studies have shown that, for children over 2 years, patterns of validity were consistent in lower and higher-SES groups <span class="citation">(Feldman et al. <a href="references.html#ref-feldman2005">2005</a>; Reese and Read <a href="references.html#ref-reese2000">2000</a>)</span>. Thus, SES-differences could reflect valid delays in children’s language development that parallel those obtained with different methods, such as naturalistic observation or standardized tests (e.g., <span class="citation">Hammer, Farkas, and Maczuga (<a href="references.html#ref-hammer2010">2010</a>)</span>). A unique and important extension of this work for Wordbank is to examine the consistency of SES differences across a large number of languages and hence, language communities which may vary in the social impact of SES gradients.</p>
<p>Fourth, as discussed above, the items on the original CDI instruments were chosen to be a representative sample of vocabulary for the appropriate age and language <span class="citation">(L. Fenson et al. <a href="references.html#ref-fenson1994">1994</a>)</span>. The checklists contain some words that most, including the youngest, children are able to understand or produce, some words that are understood or produced by the “average” child, and some which only children who are relatively more advanced will understand or produce. This structure ensures that the list has the psychometric property of capturing individual differences in vocabulary both across younger and older children and across children of different developmental levels. Validity of the CDIs has been demonstrated in reference to both standardized tests and naturalistic language sampling (see Chapter 4 of <span class="citation">L. Fenson et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-fenson2007">2007</a>)</span>). Note that the checklists were not originally constructed with the intention that responses on individual items would be reliable. While item level responses provide useful information about patterns across children are likely to understand or produce, responses on the vocabulary checklist do not necessarily license the conclusion that a child would respond appropriately when asked “can you say ____?” by an experimenter in a confrontation naming task. Nonetheless, if parents’ observations at the item level reflect any signal–even in the context of significant influence from other factors–then this signal should be observable by aggregating together data from many children.</p>
<p>Fifth, while the lengths of the vocabulary checklists on the CDIs may give the impression that they yield an estimate of the child’s full vocabulary, in fact the vocabulary size estimates only reflect a child’s relative standing compared to other children assessed with the same list of words<span class="citation">(<span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, see Mayor and Plunkett <a href="references.html#ref-mayor2011">2011</a> for discussion)</span>. Such estimates should not be misconstrued as a comprehensive estimate of the child’s vocabulary knowledge, as CDI scores likely understate the size of a child’s “true” vocabulary substantially, especially for older children <span class="citation">(Mayor and Plunkett <a href="references.html#ref-mayor2011">2011</a>)</span>. Moreover, while it is tempting to ask parents to indicate additional words that their child might be able to understand or say, users should be aware that including those items introduces bias in the estimates.</p>
<p>Finally, when a parent reports on a word on the vocabulary checklist, there is no information about the actual form of the word used, and hence, these vocabulary estimates can say little about phonological development (e.g. segmental v. suprasegmental approaches to the analysis of speech). Parents are instructed that they should check that a child can produce a word even if it is pronounced in the child’s “special way,” and only approximates the adult form. We also gain little information about the frequency with which children use a particular word in their spontaneous speech, nor can we know the range of contexts in which individual lexical items are used (e.g., is that word used productively vs. in a memorized chunk of speech).</p>
<p>In sum, despite these limitations, when used appropriately, the CDI instruments yield reliable and valid estimates of total vocabulary size. Because the instruments were designed to minimize bias by targeting current behaviors and asking parents about highly salient features of their child’s abilities, they have proven to be an important tool in the field, dozens of studies demonstrating concurrent and predictive relations with naturalistic and observational measures, in both typically-developing and at-risk populations <span class="citation">(e.g., Dale and Fenson <a href="references.html#ref-dale1996">1996</a>; Thal, Jackson-Maldonado, and Acosta <a href="references.html#ref-thal2000">2000</a>; Marchman and Martínez-Sussmann <a href="references.html#ref-marchman2002">2002</a>)</span>. In addition, a variety of recent work has shown that individual item-level responses can yield exciting new insights, for example about the growth patterns of semantic networks when aggregated across children <span class="citation">(Hills et al. <a href="references.html#ref-hills2009">2009</a>; Hills et al. <a href="references.html#ref-hills2010">2010</a>)</span>. Such analyses have the potential to be even more powerful when applied to larger samples and across languages as they are within Wordbank.</p>

<div id="adaptation-not-translation" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.4.1</span> Adaptation, not translation!</h3>
<p>Originally designed for English, parallel CDI instruments have now been adapted for more than 90 languages (<a href="http://mb-cdi.stanford.edu/adaptations.html" class="uri">http://mb-cdi.stanford.edu/adaptations.html</a>), with data from 28 of those languages currently available in Wordbank <span class="citation">(Dale and Penfold <a href="references.html#ref-dale2011">2011</a>)</span>. The ethic behind the development of these instruments is “adaptation, not translation” – in other words, create forms with the same spirit as the English form, but do not simply translate the items <span class="citation">(Dale <a href="references.html#ref-dale2015">2015</a>)</span>. Instead, developers have been strongly encouraged to craft instruments that reflect the linguistic and cultural contexts that influence the early acquisition of vocabulary and other aspects of language in that particular language.</p>
<p>The resulting forms vary widely, including differences in length and intended age range. Some forms include hundreds of items more than the original 680 words on the English Words &amp; Sentences form; others are so-called “short forms” and include only a hundred or a few hundred carefully selected words. Some are designed to capture development from the emergence of language through ages 3–4 years, while others are focused on very early development (like the English Words &amp; Gestures form, designed for ages 8–18 months).</p>
<p>While many words on the English-language checklist may easily translate to other languages, others will simply not be relevant within the same developmental time frame for children learning that new language, e.g., <em>cheese</em> in Japanese or <em>snow</em> in Arabic. Conversely, additional words may be needed in the new language which were not included on the English-language vocabulary checklist, e.g., <em>tortilla</em> in Mexican Spanish. In all languages, though, the vocabulary checklists include words that appear earlier and later in normal development, as well as a similar proportion of words from different lexical classes, for example, nouns, verbs, adjectives, and so on. Taken individually then, each adapted instrument captures key trends in vocabulary development aggregated across all items on the respective checklists.</p>
<p>Further, due to variation in language structure and the interests of the developers of CDI adaptations, the CDI instruments vary in structure across languages. Most adaptations of the W&amp;G generally include gestures as well as vocabulary comprehension and production, however, it is not always the case. Further, while adaptations of the W&amp;S always include vocabulary production, not all instruments also contain some measures of grammar, for example, early use of closed-class morphology or combinatorial syntax. Note that linguistic differences render the structure and format of many parts of the grammar sections to be very different, and hence, not amenable to comparisons across languages. A few instruments included in our dataset are pure checklists, with no other sections included. In sum, CDIs are a useful tool for many languages, but the forms differ between languages.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.4.2</span> Our approach</h3>
<p>The wide cross-linguistic adoption of the CDI provides an opportunity for cross-linguistic comparison but it also creates many challenges that are not present in datasets that are designed from the start for such comparions. Differences in instruments and items as well as differences in samples and administration conditions all make it potentially quite problematic to compare scores and score distributions across forms. We discuss differences in instruments and items here and defer discussion of differences in samples and administration to Chapter <a href="methods.html#methods">3</a>.</p>
<p>Obviously differences in length between CDI forms mean that comparisons of raw scores across instruments are inappropriate. Dividing raw scores by the total number of items on a form results in proportions, which are somewhat more comparable but still potentially misleading. A more comprehensive form with more items on it will yield lower proportions for children with the same vocabulary size. Despite this weakness, we typically use proportions for visualizing differences across forms as it is cumbersome to compare raw scores with different totals. More discussion of absolute and relative vocabulary size differences between instruments can be found in Chapter <a href="vocab.html#vocab">4</a>.</p>
<p>Like other psychometric instruments, CDI instruments can also be normed, and many of the most popular forms are. In the standard norming process, the form is administered to a large typically-developing sample so that percentile ranks can be computed. For new administrations, the percentile of a particular raw score can be computed and used in place of the proportions or raw scores. These percentile ranks can be useful for clinical purposes, but they also complicate comparison across instruments because of potential differences in the norming population to begin with. In addition, the Wordbank dataset includes normed and un-normed forms, and for the normed forms, we sometimes have access to both the norming dataset and other data but sometimes only have access to the norming data. For these reasons, we do not employ normative percentile ranks in our analyses.</p>
<p>As the preceding discussion shows, there are serious difficulties that crop up immediately in comparisons across instruments. We will grapple with these difficulties throughout the book, but we generally adopt two approaches that help us navigate this complexity. The first approach, which is used in the majority of chapters, we describe below. The second approach is described in the next subsection.</p>
<p>In general, our approach to cross-linguistic and cross-instrument data is to provide standardized analyses within each instrument and language, without assuming equivalence across words, instruments, or populations. Thus, we will typically investigate a particular phenomenon (say the “noun bias” or the “female advantage”) independently and in parallel for each of the instruments available to us.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> We can then – still with caution – analyze and compare the magnitude of this phenomenon across languages, having abstracted away from the specifics of each particular instrument. We sometimes colloquially refer to this approach as “every form an island,” meaning that each instrument is analyzed separately and only the analytic results at the highest level are compared.</p>
<p>Cross-linguistic conceptual comparisons are fraught, both philosophically <span class="citation">(e.g., Quine <a href="references.html#ref-quine1960">1960</a>)</span> and practically. We refer to the practical issue as the <em>tortilla</em> problem: in American English, we have the word <em>bread</em>, which translates to <em>pan</em> in Mexican Spanish. But the Spanish word <em>tortilla</em> takes some of the cultural role of <em>bread</em> in English; <em>bread</em> has two reasonable translations. These translation issues go the other way as well: <em>reloj</em> translates to two distinct words (<em>clock</em> and <em>watch</em>) in English. For this reason, we typically adopt the “every form an island” approach described above. But questions nevertheless arise in the course of analyzing CDI data that can only be answered by comparison across languages (see e.g., Chapter <a href="aoapred.html#aoapred">10</a>).</p>
<p>Thus, in order to facilitate (cautious) cross-linguistic comparison, we developed a set of rough-and-ready translation equivalents. We call these “unilemmas” (short for “universal lemmas”). A “lemma” is a canonical form of a word, typically used for gathering frequency counts across different morphological variants (e.g., <em>walk</em> is the lemma for <em>walks</em>, <em>walked</em>, and <em>walking</em>). Unilemmas are used for mapping distinct lexical forms across languages. Unilemmas enable a number of desirable analyses, but more practically, they also provide consistent glosses that make it easier for researchers to work in languages with which they are not familiar. For convenience, our unilemmas are written in English, but they could of course have been written in any other language as well. Further details on the unilemmas are given in Chapter <a href="methods.html#methods">3</a>.</p>
<p>Even with the care we used here to construct a robust set translation equivalents, individual items are likely to only be roughly equivalent cross-linguistically, and may have significantly different referential scopes for children learning the different languages. That is, if a parent indicates that a child can produce the word <em>dog</em> in English and another parent indicates the translation equivalent in, for example, Spanish (<em>perro</em>), it may nevertheless be the case that these words are heard more or less frequently and in different contexts in the two languages. An important empirical question is the degree to which translation equivalents across languages have consistent developmental profiles.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Our data: Wordbank</h2>
<p>To take advantage of the opportunity posed by the broad use of CDI instruments in the child language community, in 2014 we began constructing Wordbank, an open repository for CDI data that allows for interactive analysis and visualization. Our inspiration for Wordbank came from two successful projects for sharing data on children’s language acquisition. The first is the Child Language Data Exchange System <span class="citation">(CHILDES; MacWhinney <a href="references.html#ref-macwhinney2000">2000</a>)</span>. A database of transcripts of children’s speech and speech to children, CHILDES has grown into a robust and important tool for the community, with many contributors and affiliated projects. The second is the Cross-Linguistic Lexical Norms site <span class="citation">(<a href="www.cdi-clex.org">CLEX</a>; R. N. Jørgensen et al. <a href="references.html#ref-jorgensen2010">2010</a>)</span>, which is closer in content to Wordbank, and effectively our precursor. CLEX archived normative data from a range of CDI adaptations across languages, allowing browsing of acquisition trajectories for individual items or age groups.</p>
<p>Wordbank initially built on CLEX, offering the same functionality but allowing flexible and interactive visualization and analysis, as well as direct database access and data download. In addition, Wordbank’s goal was always to extend beyond normative data by dynamically incorporating data from many different researchers and projects of varying sizes and scopes. While the resulting datasets in Wordbank are much more heterogeneous than norming data, they are also larger and more representative than the individual norming datasets (in some cases), and available in languages where no norms exist (for others).</p>
<p>While there are inherent limitations in comparing different instruments across languages – limitations that we return to again and again throughout the book – our dataset is the first that allows the exploration of both child- and item-level data within- and across such a large and diverse set of languages. As such, the availability of these adaptations remain at the core of the analyses that we offer within Wordbank.</p>
<p>We began the Wordbank project – our first large-scale, data-aggregation project – with a relatively naive attitude. We thought “if you build it, they will come”: that contributors would flock to the opportunity to share their data with the world. We were unprepared for the challenges of contacting academics around the world, asking them to volunteer their time and hard-won data to an unknown cause, and then understanding the myriad formats and conventions represented in the data we eventually received. For the first couple of years, our data were largely co-extensive with those gathered by CLEX.</p>
<p>Fortunately, in the years since the Wordbank project began, attitudes towards data sharing have been shifting rapidly <span class="citation">(in part as a result of work on replication and reproducibility, e.g. Collaboration and others <a href="references.html#ref-osc2015">2015</a>)</span>. In addition, the credibility of the Wordbank project has gradually grown, in part due to the support of the MacArthur-Bates CDI advisory board. And as we received successively more data, our expertise in dealing with heterogeneous datasets has grown. Thus, the dataset has grown quickly in recent years. We hope that in future, authors see contribution to Wordbank as an aspirational endpoint for future studies using CDI instruments.</p>
