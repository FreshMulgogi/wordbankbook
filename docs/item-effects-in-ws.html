<p>Our next analysis examines items in the same WS dataset. The plot above shows item discrimination and difficulty, with outlying items labeled. Visual inspection shows a long tail of items with limited discrimination and low difficulty (e.g., <em>mommy</em>, <em>ball</em>, <em>bye</em>, etc.). These are clearly those items that are produced by nearly all of the children in the sample – they do not discriminate because they are passed by all children in the sample. If the only goal of the instrument were discrimination of different ability levels, they could likely be removed. On the lower right hand side of the plot, the remainder of items are clumped, with discrimination above zero and somewhat higher difficulty. The right-hand tip of this triangle shows the most diagnostic words (e.g., <em>run</em>, <em>kitchen</em>, and <em>table</em>), all of which effectively distinguish between the upper and lower groups of children in the sample. Finally, at the bottom of this triangle is a large cluster of words that are quite difficult. Some of these do not show good discrimination (e.g., <em>country</em>), since it is likely too difficult for nearly all children in the sample.</p>
<p><img src="wordbank-book_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We can follow up on the question of word inclusion by examining the distribution of discrimination parameters alone. Overall, this plot suggests that there are some items that could be dropped without major penalty. In particular, along with the very easy words in the left tail, there is a large cluster of words that are perhaps too difficult to be useful for most children.</p>
<p><img src="wordbank-book_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>As a separate check on this analysis, we can examine the upper and lower bounds estimated for particular words. These bounds show words that are known by only a small number of children at ceiling or have a very high floor (respectively). Examining those with a very low ceiling, we see items that are likely to be quite idiosyncratic, for a variety of reasons. For example, <em>babysitter</em>, <em>camping</em>, and <em>basement</em> likely vary by children’s home experiences (further mediated by access to resources, parenting practices, and circumstances). In contrast, genital items (e.g. <em>vagina*</em>) vary by gender (see Chapter <a href="words-demographics.html#words-demographics">8</a>). Examining those items with a very high base rate shows a similar set to those with very low discrimination patterns, suggesting that the four-parameter model may have fit these words as having a high chance level with essentially no discrimination ability.</p>
<p><img src="wordbank-book_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Finally, we see items like <em>grrr</em>, <em>woof woof</em>, <em>moo</em>, and <em>yum yum</em>. These items show limited development across the age range of the instrument. Although most parents report children saying <em>yum yum</em> early, it is likely that some families either do not say <em>yum yum</em> or do not report it on the form as a signal of gustatory pleasure (perhaps because their 30-month-old already says <em>delicious</em>).</p>
<div id="production-and-comprehension" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">G.1</span> Production and comprehension</h2>
<p><img src="wordbank-book_files/figure-html/load_irt_data_wg-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We next use IRT to estimate whether there are differences between production and comprehension, using WG data. The plot above shows IRT parameter values for discrimination and difficulty for production and comprehension (a few extreme parameter values are truncated in the plot for ease of seeing general trends). There are clear distribution differences on both measures. Difficulty is much higher (negative values) for production relative to comprehension, reflecting the expected asymmetry.</p>
<p>We also see clear evidence that in general comprehension items show less discrimination, consistent with the hypothesis that production behavior is a clearer signal of children’s underlying knowledge than assumed comprehension. This pattern is visible in two ways. First, discrimination values are negative for more items in comprehension, indicating items that are not measuring ability. Second, and more importantly, mean discrimination is substantially lower for comprehension relative to production (1.1 vs. 1.8). Very few comprehension items have discrimination is greater than 2.</p>
<p>This pattern of findings – lower discrimination values for comprehension – could be due to at least two possibilities. One is that parents are better reporters of production than comprehension, and hence these items are more discriminative of true behavior. The source of error in this case would be parents’ mistaken belief that their child understands a word. The second is that comprehension is a fundamentally more variable construct and that, hence, individual word knowledge consistent with understanding could be due to partial knowledge. Here the source of error is variance in how well children know the meanings of words. We cannot distinguish between these two models, but they have very different underlying implications for the CDI. On the first model, comprehension is simply hard to measure with parent report. On the second, comprehension is perhaps a richer and more nuanced behavior than production.</p>
</div>
<div id="properties-by-lexical-category" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">G.2</span> Properties by lexical category</h2>
<p>One hypothesis that we have often speculated about is the question of whether there are special psychometric issues with particular word classes. For example, do parents struggle especially to identify whether children produce or understand function words?</p>
<p><img src="wordbank-book_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The plot above reproduces the WG by-item analyses above but with color given by lexical class. Many of the easy, non-discriminating items are found in the “other” section. In contrast, the hardest items tend to be function words. These items tend to have lower discrimination on average (1.3) compared with nouns (1.8), adjectives (1.9), and especially verbs (2.1). Nevertheless, the situation is not dire: most have a discrimination parameter above one. Thus, although function words are not the most discriminative items on the CDI WS, these items still appear to encode valid signal about children’s abilities.</p>
<p><img src="wordbank-book_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>In our last analysis, we turn to the WG data. The plot above shows the mean and standard deviation for discrimination parameter values. In production, the higher discrimination shown on the whole (above) is likely due to the strong performance of nouns. In contrast, mean discrimination for other words is low. This pattern may be due to the overall sparsity of early production data for non-noun items. In comprehension, in contrast, there is a moderate level of discrimination for all classes except “other” (which includes items like <em>mommy</em> and <em>daddy</em> and a variety of animal sounds and social routines). One hypothesis about this finding is that, especially early on, parents are very generous in their interpretation of whether their child understands these words.</p>
<p>In sum, we do not find evidence that function words are particularly bad. Rather, there are some low-performing items spread across all categories of the CDI form, and many of these likely perform poorly for the reasons described above – especially difficulty in interpretation of very early behavior and variability in home experience.</p>
