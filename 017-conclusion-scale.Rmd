# Language Development at Scale {#conclusion-scale}

This chapter synthesizes knowledge gained from the broader enterprise, in the sense of attempting to make generalizations about early language development that hold true across the different datasets in our sample. We begin by briefly reviewing the content of our findings across the preceding substantive chapters. Next, we discuss three synthetic generalizations from these findings. We then turn to the question of the particular process universals that might be compatible with this empirical picture.

## Summary

We began with the question of what parent report can tell us about children's early language. We are now in a better position to answer this question, summarizing findings across the content chapters of the manuscript. 

In Chapter \@ref(psychometrics), we reviewed evidence for the reliability and validity of parent report instruments for assesssing children's early language, with generally positive conclusions. Further, we contributed two sets of novel analyses. First, examining large-scale longitudinal datasets, we estimated the fall-off in test-retest correlations over developmental time, which suggested a relatively high level of reliability overall. Second, we used item response theory (IRT) models to examine the measurement properties of individual words on the CDI. Overall most items had strong psychometric performance, and even comprehension reports appeared to have consistent informational value about a child's overall abilities (although individual items appeared less diagnostic on average than production reports). The broad picture from this chapter was positive, motivating further use of CDI data. 

Chapter \@ref(vocabulary) then examined trends in the growth and distribution of individual vocabulary estimates. Across languages, and for production and comprehension, early vocabulary starts slow and grows rapidly in the second year after birth. There are both absolute and relative differences between languages in the estimated rate of vocabularly growth, however. While some of these may reflect true differences (for example, Danish being famously difficult to acquire), others likely stem from differences in instrument, sample, and administration conditions. On the other hand, we observed a striking consistency across languages in the degree to which children varied. This finding suggests the operation of individual- and dyad-level processes that vary systematically in a way that is somewhat independent of the precise content being acquired and the cultural background of acquisition. On average, language emerges quickly - but despite the average pattern, toddlers around the world are "all over the place" in their learning rate.

Chapter \@ref(demographics) considered demographic predictors of vocabulary size. We found a general female advantage in early vocabulary that was more pronounced for production than comprehension. This advantage did not appear to stem from reporting bias, and was relatively consistent in size across languaes. We also observed a first-born advantage and an advantage for children with more-educated mothers (likely a proxy for general socio-economic status). Chapter \@ref(items-demographics) followed up these analyses by identifying whether specific words were the locus of some of these differences. The conclusion of these analyses were that there were *both* general demographic differences in vocabulary *and* word-specific differences. For example, girls both on average have a higher probability of knowing any word, and they also have a much higher probability of knowing words like "dress" and "doll."

Turning to gestural communication, Chapter \@ref(gesture) showed that early gestures are both quite consistent with one another and quite consistent across languages. In other words, gestures appear to group together as part of a set of communicative abilities (rather than existing as isolated items). A small set of similar gestures are often the earliest emerging across languages, likely arising from relatively universal dyadic needs (e.g., a signal for "pick me up" or "give me"). Finally, early gestures are quite well correlated with early vocabulary within individuals.

Like early gestures, early words are often surprisingly similar across languages. In Chapter \@ref(items-consistency), we quantified this similarity and showed that it was related to typological relatedness. On the other hand, even quite dissimilar languages had a good number of the same words in children's earliest vocabulary. Like early gestures, these early vocabulary items likely reflect relatively universal communicative needs in infant-caregiver dyads (we return to this theme below in the section on Generalizations). 

In Chapter \@ref(items-prediction), we extended this approach to the composition of vocabulary by creating predictive models of the ease or difficulty of individual words. These models, uniquely in our analyses, take into account the average environmental input for a learner of a particular language (estimated from corpus resources). Although a number of factors including input, conceptual factors, and phonological complexity interact to predict when words are first produced, the profile of predictors across languages was quite similar. We interpret this finding to point to a relatively consistent set of processes that are operating in different linguistic contexts. 

Following the thread of cross-linguistic differences, Chapter \@ref(categories-syntactic) examined the question of the syntactic composition of vocabulary across early development. Consistent with previous reports, we found that most languages exhibited a bias towards nouns, although the strength of that bias varied across languages; further essentially all languages showed a developmental bias against function words. On the other hand, the bias for predicates (verbs and adjectives) was more variable across languages, with most languages showing a negative bias but a few (Mandarin and Cantonese, in particular) showing a neutral or positive bias. This pattern of variability points to some language-specific factors (perhaps syntactic structure, perhaps other linguistic or interactional factors) that influence learning within particular syntactic categories. 

We next applied this same approach to semantic categories (Chapter \@ref(categories-semantic). Computing the relative bias for or against particular semantic categories, we found some cross-linguistic consistency in early biases: biases for body parts, games, and onomotopoiea were quite consistent; biases against words for places and time were as well. These biases suggest that there are likely some attentional and conceptual biases that facilitate or inihibit word learing in similar ways across languages. 

Turning next to syntactic development, Chapter \@ref(grammar) showed that children's morphological and grammatical ability appears tightly coupled with their vocabulary size. This generalization holds very consistently across languages, validating Bates' speculation that it is a general law of language development. This chapter also indentified a moderating effect of age on this relationship such that older children appear to gain more "units grammar" per "unit vocabulary" - that is, grammar emerges slightly faster for these older chilren. 

The last empirical chapter, Chapter \@ref(style), examined individual variability in language. This chapter presented evidence for the "referential" vs. "expressive" distinction -- that, even controlling for overall developmental level, some children appear to have larger, "noun-ier" vocabularies while others have smaller vocabularies but combine words more. Similarly, some children certainly produce relatively more of their total vocabulary than others (though these measurements are difficult to validate independent of reporting variability). On the other hand, we did not observe strong evidence for the idea that some children undergo particular vocabulary "spurts" - rather, vocabulary growth appears to accelerate relatively smoothly once statistical artifacts are accounted for. 

Finally, in the previous chapter, Chapter \@ref(conclusion-consistency), we attempted to consolidate the cross-linguistic variability in all of the findings above and place these on a single axis. This comparison revealed a number of patterns that we take up in our generalizations below. 

## Generalizations

What is the picture of language development that emerges from these individual fidings? We now return to the theoretical project of Chapter \@ref(intro-theory), which was to use patterns of consistency and variability to provide constraints on theories of early language learning. We begin by considering three major generalizations from our data, and then turn back to the question of possible learning processes that could support these generalizations.

### The language system is tightly woven

It could easily be the case that children are "pointy" with respect to language -- that is, highly proficient in some sub-aspect of languages and poor at others. A naive examiner of a group of children in a toddler classroom might conclude that the variation that they observed was supportive of such a view. In such a classroom, some children will only be able to gesture and say a few words; while some others will appear to show a large noun bias; and still others will be fluently combining words. Furthermore, these children will be distributed across a range of ages, with this progress only somewhat predicted by relative age (especially in a tightly-grouped sample from say 18--30 months). 

This viewpoint is incorrect, however. Instead, the language system is tightly woven together, such that on the whole children who are good at gesture have larger vocabulary, and children who have larger vocabulary also inflect and combine words more proficiently. These correlations within individuals are large and they are universal across those languages in which we can evaluate them. Further, while these correlations could in principle arise in CDI data from parent reporting bias across sections of a single form, they are largely borne out in a variety of observational and behavioral datasets [e.g., @brinchmann2018; @rowe2009]. 

How can the consistence and coherence of these distinct aspects of early language be reconciled with the type of variation our preschool observer might see? Consider the following model of early language. The first posit of this model is that the trajectory of children's learning follows a single, coherent path through the stages of early language. Initially, gestures and early nouns and social routines are learned. Nouns follow, leading into verbs. Verbs in turn promote word combination and morphology. The second posit is that aspects of this trajectory may be non-linear: the noun bias increases and then decreases [@bates1994]; the relation between lexicon and grammar may be flatter at one period than another [@dixon2007]. Finally, imagine a third posit: this non-linear trajectory is followed at different rates, with a child's current state partially a function of age and partially a function of their own idiosycratic learning rate. 

Under such a "unitary non-linear trajectory" model, we would still see "pointy" children in the preschool classroom. These children would be cross-sections cut from the same trajectory, but at different points along it. The younger child who knows a surprising number of names might be further along relative to age and hence firmly in the "noun bias" part of the general path. In contrast, the older child who primarily gestures might be a child with a slightly slower growth rate. Observed variation need not indicate that the subparts of language do not "hang together" (to return to the Batesian phrasing). We return below to the analyses of true variation in learning style that are reported in Chapter \@ref(style)).

Alongside its support from the cross-linguistic consistency in cross-domain correlations, this unitary view of early language is supported by several other bodies of wrok. The first is a set of longitudinal analyses by Bornstein and colleagues. In a two-cohort longitudinal study, @bornstein1998 and @bornstein2004b collected data from a sample of American English learning children at two and four years and measured language using a variety of instruments including parent report, transcripts, and behavioral tasks. In a re-analysis of these data, @bornstein2012 found that the core construct of early languaeg that emerged from the sub-measures was both highly correlated with each of the sub measures and also highly stable over time (as we noted earlier in Chapter \@ref(psychometrics)). 

In addition, research on international adoption, a unique case study of changes in learning rate relative to input, provides support for this unitary trajectory view as well. International adoptees often have to let go of their native language copletely, sometimes at a fairly old age, and begin learning a host language. A body of work by Snedeker, Geren, and Shafto [@snedeker2007;@snedeker2012] suggests that these children go through the same general course of acquisition, including an early noun bias and early gramamtical omissions, but they did so much more quickly on average then native learners. Although these children were more conceptually sophisticated and could learn faster, the informational challenges of breaking into the language were still similar on the whole. 

In sum, the language system is tightly woven or perhaps even unitary in nature. Our work here confirms and extends previous investigations by @bates1994 and @bornstein2012.  Although our data provided multiple opportunities for aspects of language development (communication, vocabulary, morphology, grammar) to pull apart across individuals into modular subsystems, they instad hung together very tightly. Further, the strength of these connections did not vary across every language examined: the nature of the trajectory was surprisingly consistent, even across languages with substantial differences in morphosyntactic structure.

### Content similarities in early language

A second broad generalization from our work here is the content similarities in children's early vocabulary across languages. Put simply, regardless of the language they are learning, children in the early stages of language learning appear to talk about similar things, especially people, social routines, small objects, and body parts. This work built on work by @tardif2008, which compared the distribution of children's first ten words across three languages. Many of the content generalizations that held for those three languages in fact hold much more broadly as well. 

We observed findinga related to this generalization in at least three aspects of our data analysis. First, relating most directly to @tardif1999's work, in Chapter \@ref(items-consistency), we observed a strong correlation in the rank order of acquisition for the earliest words. Those words that were typically learned very early in one language tended to be very early learned in others. Second, we saw that some word categories -- both syntactic and semantic -- were typically overrepresetend across languages. Nouns generally were over-represented (with some cross-linguistic variability in the amount of over-representation). But beyond that, words for body parts, games and social routines, and sounds were all over-represented. And third, when we looked for systematic predictors of the ease of learning words across language, the predictor "babiness" -- which captures association with infants -- was among the strongest predictors, especially for early-learned words. 

Where does this similarity come from? Our findings likely emerge from a combination of children's particular attention and interests; the communicative priorities of child-caregiver dyads; and the informational structure of language, which renders certain aspects of langauge easier to learn than others. We consider each of these in turn. 

The entities that are most common in children's early vocabulary are also those w

Interest- conceptual - priorities - not just frequency - drive content of vocab
- semantic bias
- no function words
- same order of acquisition
Dyadic interest and focus - very consistent across cultures

Snedeker adoption stuff - is it the learning problem or the cognitive (is it about the structure of language)
color/time/adjectives?



### Children take different routes into language

3. Despite these aggregate similarities across children and across cultures, children individually take different routes into language. The speed with which they acquire language is highly variable in the first years of life and this variability itself is a constant across cultures. Further, children vary stably in the nature of their acquisition path, soem naming more objects and others combing words relatively more.

## Learning processes

In Chapter \@ref(intro-theory), we introduced the idea of "process universals." These cannot be universals of content as all of the content being reported by parents filling CDI forms is language-specific. Intead, the idea of process universals is that there are processes that operate in different language context to produce the observed pattern of phenomena. These processes could be -- but need not be -- learner-internal. They could also operate at the level of the child-caregiver dyad, for example. 

```{r}
cvs <- read_feather("data/cvs/cvs.feather")
```

In what follows, we move away from the term "universal." Although in principle our theoretical goal is process universals, in practice thelimitations of the analysis above are such that we can only speak about "consistent processes." Not only do we have a maximum of `r max(cvs$n)` distinct language/instrument samples represented in any estimate, we have a maximum of `r length(unique(instruments$language))` languages or dialects in any analysis (and often considerably fewer) . This sample, while strong in terms of the within-language estimates, is only a weak start in terms of cross-language estimates [see @piantadosi2014 for guidance on claims about strict universals]. Further, there is a strong Indo-European and WEIRD (western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic) bias amongst the languages in the database [@henrich2010]. Thus, some consistencies that we observe are probably conditioned on *environmental* consistencies as well as dyadic and child-internal processes. In the remainder of this chapter, we speculate on some of these.

So what sort of developmental process of vocabulary learning could lead to these universals? Any claim of this sort must be very speculative. If pushed, we would point to the following (weak) proposals regarding processes that are consistent with some of our putative universals. 

1. Demographic differences are -- at least -- consistent with interactional-input theories of vocabulary development [@hart1995;@hoff2003;@weisleder2013] in which the more and higher-quality the input the child receives, the faster vocabulary grows. Under this hypothesis, first-born, female, and higher-maternal education children all are likely to receive more and higher-quality input: female children through the route of their somewhat greater social/interactional abilities (an extra assumption), first-born children through their greater allocation of parent attention, and high maternal-education children through greater parental awareness of the role of input, differering parental practices, and greater amount of leisure time to spend with children among other factors. 

2. Both the noun bias and the age-of-acquisition prediction results are consistent with the broader cross-situational viewpoint on acquisition [@smith2008;@gleitman1990]. On this view, nouns are easy to learn because the more they are heard, the more opportunities children get to build consistent mappings between the words and their referents. In contrast, verbs and other predicates rely more on a base of nouns and a basic comprehension of the syntactic structures in which they appear in order to infer meaning in context. Thus they should be acquired relatively later and with relativel more support from shorter, easier-to-parse utterances (MLU as a predictor, for example). Cross-linguistic exceptions will tend to be for languages like Mandarin where many early-learned verbs are semantically-transparent enough to be learned cross-situationally. 

3. Correlations between grammar and the lexicon, as well as the greater role of MLU in predicting acquisition of function words are both consistent with views that posit gradual syntactic abstraction and generalization. Versions of such viewpoints exist throughout the broad theoretical space of language acquisition [@yang2016;@tomasello2003;@meylan2017], but all proposals rely on a learning mechanism in which generalizations about structure are graded and rely on the amount of evidence available. 





<!-- ### Variability -->

<!-- Beginning with the first monograph reporting the CDI norming study, @fenson1994 noted that variability is perhaps the primary and most striking fact about children's vocabulary learning. In Chapter \@ref(vocabulary), we quantified this variability and found that -- across languages and spanning children's second year -- the variability was as large as the central tendency.  -->

<!-- In practical terms, the huge variance across children accounts for the fact that while some typically-developing two year olds will talk your ear off, others will barely utter a handful of words (even if they understand more). From a biological perspective, this variability is quite unprecedented. As a comparison, variation in heights for toddlers is tiny compared with variation in vocabulary: the mean height for a 24-month-old is around 33 inches, with a standard deviation of a little more than an inch, leading to a coefficient of variation around .03. This measurement is almost two orders of magnitude smaller than the coefficient of variation on vocabulary.  -->






<!-- One important class of explanations that limits our ability to make generalizations is explanations of our observations that rely on data regarding the process of gathering CDI data itself, whether they relate to: -->

<!-- * the design process for the CDI, e.g., biases on the selection of words to be included in a form; -->
<!-- * the sampling process for families, e.g., biases on backgrounds of families within and across samples; -->
<!-- * the reporting process, e.g., biases regarding particular types of children (e.g., girls) or particular types of words (e.g., function words); -->

<!-- To rule out these explanations, we need to rely on the existence of converging evidence for the same effects from other sources. Some of these sources are cited in the original chapters, but we briefly review them here. -->

<!-- **Gender** [Probably in the original CDI/gender paper, look for references?] -->

<!-- **Birth order** [??] -->

<!-- **Noun bias** [bornstein study, others cited in that chapter?] -->

<!-- **Grammar/Lexicon** [??] -->

<!-- **Predictor consistency** [at least @huttenlocher1991, maybe others for frequency. harder for babiness, etc.] -->

<!-- In sum, for many of our proposed consistencies, we can begin to muster evidence against them from convergent sources. Nevertheless, much more work is needed to measure the size (not just the direction) of these effects and compare effect size across different measurements. For example, if the same size gender effect were found in the same population with both parent report and pointing-based methods, this finding would provide evidence against a parent-reporting bias account of gender differences. This high standard has yet to be met for most of the findings we report.  -->

<!-- ## Limitations -->

<!-- All of our analyses are fundamentally correlational. No causal inferences from Wordbank data are possible. We'll say this again so you know we mean it: *no causal inferences are possible*. All of the consistencies described above admit alternative causal explanations.  -->

<!-- For example, as noted, parents could *think* that girls speak more and hence report more words for girls. Or girls could actually know more words. Similarly, first-born children could receive more language input due to the lack of other competition for parents' attention, and hence have larger vocabulary. Or parents could be *aware* of more of first-born children's vocabulary. Or both. As in the gender case, external data can provide evidence for or against particular causal explanations but in their absence we are left to speculate.  -->

<!-- For more cognitive consistencies that we observe, alternative causal interpretations are again possible. To take one example, the "noun bias" could result from any of the following causal mechansisms (as well as mixtures of these, or mixtures of these and others not described):  -->

<!-- * they could be learned more easily due to their conceptual transparency [@gentner2003];  -->
<!-- * they could be reported more frequently by parents due to some feature, such as their  imageability or concreteness; -->
<!-- * etc.  -->

<!-- Nevertheless, an observed pattern of correlations can still create a target for theory.  -->

<!-- ### Consistency  -->

<!-- How can we describe and explain this variability? While much of the variance in the distribution of children remains unexplained, we still observe some striking correlates that can provide  -->
<!--  In this sense, our work here follows what we might call the "Batesian program," the use of large-N data from the CDI to identify consistent developmental patterns that give clues to the organization of the mechanisms of language acquisition. To provide grounding to our discussion, we review consistencies below: -->

<!-- **Demographic differences**. In Chapter \@ref(vocabulary), we explored demographic differences in vocabulary. With very limited exceptions, we see a consistent advantage for girls over boys in early word learning across languages. Similarly, across (a smaller set of) languages, children with earlier birth orders are reported to have larger vocabularies. Both of these demographic differences should be considered in light of the probability of reporting biases -- for example, parents might *expect* girls to have larger vocabularies and hence report more words on average [though perhaps the consistency of the female advantage is surprising given variation in gender biases and stereotypes across countries, e.g., @nosek2009]. We return to the issue of difficulties in causal inference below.  -->

<!-- **Coefficient of Variation** Variability across kids (size of the fan) FIXME -->

<!-- **Category biases**. In Chapter \@ref(categories-syntactic), we extend previous work [e.g., @bornstein2004] by quantifying the degree of bias for and against different word classes in early vocabulary. For example, with a handful of exceptions (discussed in depth in that chapter) we see a bias for the overrepresentation of nouns in early vocabulary, at the expense of predicates and, even more so, function words.  -->

<!-- **Individual words**. Following @tardif2008, we show that there are large similarities in the most common early words. Further, we show that the predictors of what words are easier and harder across langauges are extremely consistent.  -->

<!-- **Grammar and the lexicon**. Following @bates1997, we show the tight developmental correlations between the growth of grammatical complexity in children's early language and the growth of their vocabulary.  -->









<!-- Are the chapters in the right order? -->


## Methodological themes

Wordbank embodies our belief that scale is in itself transformative. The existence of a noun bias is a fascinating observation, but this observation gives limited leverage to differentiate theories. The magnitude of a noun bias provides more leverage for quantiative theorizing. And the distribution of magnitudes across many of the world's languages gives greater leverage still. Our hope is that, by generalizing and applying many influential analyses by many contributors, our work here can affect theory more broadly.

## Conclusions

<!-- Developmental psychology often appears to be divided between two groups that do not communicate with one another. On the one hand, there are researchers interested in the ontogenetic and phylogenetic origins of knowledge -- the epistemological project of understanding how we reason about objects, communicate using language, or learn from other people [@carey2009, @spelke2007, @tomasellooriginoflanguage]. On the other hand, there are researchers interested in growth, change, and variation across individuals in psychometric constructs like executive function, working memory, and personality [@zelazo?, other cites]. The first type of research has led to a productive union of philosophical and psychological ideas, addressing many of the most exciting questions in the history of philosophy using empirical methods [@gopnik, @carey]. The second type has had success in its connections to educational policy [@nelson2007;@diamond2011, others?]. In many areas of research, these two traditions have little interchange with one another. They read different journals, record different measures, use different research designs and statisical models, and often appear to be pursuing entirely different goals.  -->

<!-- Yet language learning is an area where these traditions come together. The knowledge being acquired -- the stock of words in the child's lexicon -- is both the epistemic construct whose origins we are studying *and* the psychometric construct whose reliability across individuals we wish to assess. By studying the variability and consistency in the early lexcion, we can both study the origins of knowledge and the processes and factors by which human beings differ from one another across different cultural contexts, family environments, and genetic endowments. -->

<!-- Theorizing in language acquisition has traditionally argued on the axes defined by the nativist/empiricist debate, as well as the debate between domain-general and domain-specific representations and mechanisms. We label the implied axis of the debate here as the continuum between domain-general, empiricist theories and domain-specific, nativist theories. Anchoring one side of this continuum are statistical learning theories, that posit that domain-general mechanisms that learn structure from continuous input can induce structure from linguistic input [CITES: rethinking innateness, etc.]. On the other side are content-nativist theories that posit language-specific representational structures, such as the Principles and Parameters theory [@chomsky1981, @baker2005].  -->

<!-- For all the reasons described above, we do not believe that the observed consistencies directly bear on traditional questions of the mechanisms underlying language acquisition. Taking the correlation between grammar and the lexicon as a case study: theoretical proposals from many parts of the space shown in Figure \@ref(fig:theoryspace) can account for these data. For example, a purely bottom-up statistical generalization mechanism would clearly produce a correlation between lexical and grammatical structure [as in @bates1997's original propopsal]; statistical generalizations require lexical data and so more data should correlate with more generalization. But a more domain-specific nativist grammatical proposal might also produce this correlation, provided that it required triggering data [e.g., @gibson1994, @yang2015tolerance]. And many variations in between.  -->



<!-- the consistencies we observe across languages point to putative universals: generalizations that hold across very disparate populations of human children learning typologically distinct languages. Surely such universals should be an important basis for theorizing about language acquisition. A theory that accounted for such universals "for free" -- as a result of basic assumptions about the nature of the learning mechansisms -- would be able to claim more and broader evidence, for example.  -->
