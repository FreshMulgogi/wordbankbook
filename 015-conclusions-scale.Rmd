# Synthesis: Language Development at Scale {#theory2}

This chapter synthesizes knowledge gained from the broader wordbank package, in the sense of attempting to make generalizations about early language development that hold true across the different datasets in our sample. 


1. The first words are very consistent across languages and largely social in nature
2. Early social/communicative gesture is correlated with language.
3. Across children, variability is a constant in early language.
4. While there is a noun bias in early language, verbs/adjectives vary by language.
5. The growth of grammar is linked to vocabulary growth.
