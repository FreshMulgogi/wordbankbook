001-theory.Rmd:Nativist proposals, in contrast, tend to focus on the complexity of the grammatical structures that young children appear to possess, relative to their rarity in children's environment. Such arguments emphasize the poverty of the linguistic stimulus [e.g., @legate2002] in contrast to the richness of the structural generalizations children make [e.g., @crain2000]. The type of proposals that are on offer within this space often include "principles and parameters"-type theories, in which languages share a set of syntactic principles that govern syntactic combination but vary on a relatively small set of parameters that control how these structures vary [@baker2005;@yang2002]. These proposals are challenged by the vast cross-linguistic differences in syntactic abstractions [@evans2009], by the character and scope of children's syntactic generalizations [which are often tied to specific lexical structures; @tomasello2000], and by evidence of early input-sensitive learning and generalization both within specific domains [e.g., @meylan2017] and in artificial language tasks [@gomez1999]. Such proposals also tend to downplay the inherent variability that characterizes language learning across individuals [@bates1988;@bates1994], focusing instead on the universals or commonalities that exist across children. While nativist proposals acknowledge that individual variation exists, variation is thought to serve a primarily descriptive function, existing in a "theoretical vacuum" [@bloom2002, p. 52], with greater emphasis on how language acquisition works in the general case. 
001-theory.Rmd:The "great debate" between these viewpoints is philosophically appealing, but has also led to a polarization of the field of language acquisition. Typically researchers work in their own siloed traditions (empiricist or nativist), and focus on individual phenomena that do not make contact with one another -- a classic version of @kuhn1970's "paradigms." Research in the nativist tradition often focuses on particular syntactic phenomena that are largely neglected in the empiricist tradition [e.g., the "optional infinitive," @wexler1998; but cf. @freudenthal2010]. In contrast, research in the empiricist tradition has often used artificial language learning tasks that are argued not to reflect on the underlying structural properties that are claimed to be innate [e.g., @lany2010; cf. @yang2004]. Empiricist theories are also more likely to recognize the causes and consequences of individual variation in rates of learning, including potential sources of that variation that arise from variation in the circumstances in which children learn and the opportunities they have for engaging with language in a meaningful way (e.g., @huttenlocher1991; @hoff2006; @weisleder2013).  By focusing on different paradigms and phenomena and theorizing using distinct vocabularies, these traditions make limited contact. Often, language development conferences feature paired keynote talks from these two different traditions -- a clear sign of polarization.
001-theory.Rmd:In addition, these theories are frameworks, rather than than actual hypotheses. Few proposals within these frameworks can be said to generate testable and clearly competing predictions, even within a specific domain. And any individual observation typically cannot be said to be inconsistent with any but the absolute strongest nativist or empiricist position. To be tested, proposals must make specific predictions.  Computational models have been an important method for allowing proposals to be instantiated to the degree that they can make testable predictions. In practice, however models typically end up less differentiated than framework rhetoric suggests. In order to get off the ground in performing a particular empirical task, theories must often help themselves to generous amounts of both innate structure -- in the form of structured inputs from social, cognitive, or perceptual domains -- and statistical learning abilities [@roy2002;@alishahi2008;@frank2009;@frank2010;@yang2004].^[The research on the nature of inflectional morphology -- the "past tense debate" -- is one place where computational models played a foundational role in instantiating theoretical claims about innateness and representational structure [e.g., @rumelhart1986;@pinker1988;@plunkett1993;@plunkett1991;@plunkett1996;@marcus1995;@marchman1997].]
001-theory.Rmd:From an evolutionary perspective, syntax is far from the only unique or notable feature of human communication [@pinker2005;@tomasello2010]. The nature and range of communicative gestures, the variety of sounds, and the diversity of lexical items all are relatively unprecedented -- especially in the primate lineage. And these observable aspects of language -- as well as the emergence of syntactic structure more broadly -- are some of what makes the broad course of language acquisition striking from the perspective of a clinician or a parent. We notice the first communicative signals, the emergence and rapid growth of of vocabulary, the beginning of the productive combination of words, increases in the length and complexity of utterances, and the patterns of error and overgeneralization that remain in early childhood.  Moreover, there is considerable evidence for continuity across these domains [e.g., @bornstein2012;@tsao2004;@bates1988;@cristia2014]. Children's earliest gestures and sounds relate to their oral language comprehension and production. And these in turn relate to later skill in using language as a tool for learning, through both the auditory (or visual, in the case of sign language) as well as the written modality. 
001-theory.Rmd:These broader patterns of language learning are the natural focus of investigations like ours that use parent report to learn about children's language. Parents are attentive and accurate observers of communicative gesture, vocabulary, and word combination. But without linguistic training they may not even notice subtleties like non-productive determine use, auxilliary inversion, or anaphoric "one." Further, these investigations can in many case make productive contact with the rich literatures on early communication, speech perception [e.g., @kuhl2004], word learning [e.g., @bloom2002;@snedeker2009], and grammatical productivity through verb structure [@fisher2010]. While debates over the nature of syntactic knowledge and abstraction have raged, other subfields of language acquisition have prospered. 
001-theory.Rmd:Further, since these processes are fundamentally learning processes, they operate at the timescale of moment-to-moment interactions [@frank2009;@mcmurray2012]. In contrast, using the CDI, we observe the accretion of vocabulary and linguistic competence over the course of millions of these interactions [see e.g., @dupoux2018 for estimates]. This mismatch makes inferences about the nature of the processes even trickier -- in some sense, we are attempting to uncover what forces eroded a hillside when all we see are the uncovered strata. 
001-theory.Rmd:The second set of language-specific particulars that might lead to variance across languages is the vast cultural variability across the communities represented in the Wordbank data. Our data contain both "individualist" and "collectivist" cultures [@markus1991;@nisbett2001] as well as both "loose fit" and "tight fit" cultures [@gelfand2011]. To the extent that parenting differs across these cultures -- and there is good evidence that it does [e.g., @bornstein2013] -- we should see variance in the trajectory of language learning. For example, it would be quite reasonable to predict that the female advantage in vocabulary acquisition might vary as a function of cross-national gender biases [@nosek2009]. Yet it is strikingly consistent overall (presaging the conclusions in Chapter \@ref(demographics)), again arguing that -- at the broadest level, at least -- variable cultural factors do not dominate other processes in the acquisition of vocabulary. 
002-practical_foundations.Rmd:Naturalistic observations are the other leading candidate for measurement of early language, but such observations are extremely costly and time-consuming to transcribe and annotate. These difficulties lead to a tradeoff where most studies either include dense data about a small number of children or smaller amounts of data with a larger sample size. Dense datasets currently provide the best method for in-depth study of the interaction between learning mechanisms and language input in individuals [e.g., @lieven2009; @roy2015]. The generalizability of these studies is necessarily limited by their small sample sizes, and sample sizes are in turn limited by the costs and practicality of gathering and transcribing such data [see e.g., @bergelson2017 for the state of the art]. At the other end of the spectrum, assessment of many individual language samples can yield information about individual variability [e.g., @dickinson2001; @cartmill2013; @weisleder2013], but at some cost in terms of depth.
002-practical_foundations.Rmd:Finally, naturalistic observations do not measure children's language comprehension, a variable of interest for many early language researchers. Estimates of production vocabulary from naturalistic observation are highly correlated with the CDI within studies [e.g., @bornstein1998], but are likely to be affected substantially by length of the session, context, and interlocutor when comparing across studies [see e.g., @hidaka2015 for discussion]. And although there exist methods to extract insights about global vocabulary from naturalistic observation, these statistical extrapolations are relatively new and have not been validated extensively [@hidaka2015]. 
002-practical_foundations.Rmd:Experimental testing, in contrast, is an execellent method for measuring individual aspects of children's linguistic competence, for example their knowledge of a handful of words or their speed of processing [e.g., @bergelson2012;@fernald2006]. These methods are much less subject to the confounding of observational methods. But an infant or toddler can only provide a limited number of trials during a single measurement session, even in implicit tasks using eye-movements. Thus, the ability to measure global language competence is limited. Further, the specific words to measure for children of different ages vary -- those words that are appropriate for measuring a 14-month-old's competence are trivially easy for a 24-month-old. And attrition can be quite high for a long measurement session, requiring repeated testing for many participants. Other comprehension vocabulary measures are also available across some range of languages [e.g., the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test 4; @dunn2007, the Computerized Comprehension Task (CCT), @friend2008], but most of these assessments are tailored for children older than 2 1/2 years. 
002-practical_foundations.Rmd:Cross-linguistic conceptual comparisons are fraught, both philosophically [e.g., @quine1960] and practically. We refer to the practical issue as the *tortilla* problem: in American English, we have the word *bread*, which translates to *pan* in Mexican Spanish. But the Spanish word *tortilla* takes some of the cultural role of *bread* in English; *bread* has two reasonable translations. These translation issues go the other way as well: *reloj* translates to two distinct words (*clock* and *watch*) in English. For this reason, we typically adopt the "every form an island" approach described above. But questions nevertheless arise in the course of analyzing CDI data that can only be answered by comparison across languages (see e.g., Chapter \@ref(aoapred)). 
002-practical_foundations.Rmd:First, our analyses here focus exclusively on typical development. The study of atypical language development is an important part of characterizing the mechansims of acquisition; further, characterizing language development in these circumstances can have important applied benefits. Studies of language in developmental disorders [@tager-flusberg2009;@eigsti2011], in cases of sensory deficits [@landau2009], and in cases of abnormal input [@curtiss1977], among others. Many of these studies have made use of dense observations of individual children, however, an approach that is fundamentally different than our large-scale, statistical approach here. While CDI-type instruments are increasinly being used with atypical populations [e.g., @charman2003;@luyster2007], in practice these datasets still tend to be smaller, concentrated in on English-speaking children, and difficult to access publicly. Thus, Wordbank does not currently archive stufficient data from atypical populations to justify inclusion of these analyses in the current book. 
002-practical_foundations.Rmd:Second, the Wordbank dataset focuses on monolingual acqusition. CDI instruments were initially developed to provide normative measurements of variation within a single language. Since then, however, they have increasingly been used for comparison between monolingual and bilingual groups based on the administration of CDIs in both languages [e.g., @pearson1993;@hoff2012]. These studies initially focused on specific bilingual populations (e.g., Spanish/English bilinguals). Recent studies have moved beyond this strategy and have begun to examine general trends aross multiple bilingual pairings [e.g., @bilson2015;@floccia2018]. Questions of bilingual acquisition are fascinating and important from both a theoretical and practical perspective. But there are practical obstacles to applying our approach to bilingual data that mean that this book does not consider the bilingual acquisition situation. First, because most of the largest CDI datasets were generated from monolingual norming studies, the vast majority of our data are not bilingual. Second, the combinatorics of bilingualism mean that data on nearly all language pairs will be non-existant. For these reasons, our book focuses on monolingual acquisition, though we recognize this as a limitation that must be addressed by future work. 
003-methods.Rmd:1. On paper in a lab or other space, with instructions given in person by a researcher [e.g., @fenson1994];
003-methods.Rmd:3. Electronically, with instructions given either electronically or by phone [e.g., @kristoffersen2013]. 
003-methods.Rmd:We have limited direct evidence about the effects of particular administration details on the overall results. Such evidence would require random assignment of parents to administration method rather than, e.g., a comparison of administration methods across different populations in which there are obvious sample-related confounds. Nevertheless, the CDI community has amassed a substantial set of anecdotal experiences. For example, improper administration or limited instructions can result in over- or under-reporting, especially with respect to comprehension [see e.g., @feldman2000]. 
004-psychometrics.Rmd:Third, there is some evidence that variability in reporting biases may be moderated by factors such as SES [@feldman2000; @fenson2000; @feldman2005]. Some studies suggest that parents from some SES groups may be more likely to underestimate child's abilities [@roberts1999], while others report that parents from lower-SES groups may over-estimate children's abilities, especially comprehension at younger ages [@goldfield1990; @feldman2000). Later studies, however, have shown that for children over 2 years patterns of validity were consistent in lower and higher-SES groups [@feldman2005; @reese2000]. Thus, SES-differences could reflect valid delays in children’s language development that parallel those obtained with different methods, such as naturalistic observation or standardized tests [e.g., @hammer2010]. 
004-psychometrics.Rmd:In sum, despite these limitations, when used appropriately, the CDI instruments yield reliable and valid estimates of total vocabulary size. Because the instruments were designed to minimize bias by targeting current behaviors and asking parents about highly salient features of their child's abilities, they have proven to be an important tool in the field. Dozens of studies demonstrate concurrent and predictive relations with naturalistic and observational measures, in both typically-developing and at-risk populations [e.g., @dale1996; @thal1999; @marchman2002]. In addition, a variety of recent work has shown that individual item-level responses can yield exciting new insights, for example about the growth patterns of semantic networks when aggregated across children [@hills2009; @hills2010]. Such analyses have the potential to be even more powerful when applied to larger samples and across languages.
005-vocabulary.Rmd:One striking aspect of comprehension data is how early comprehension is reported.  For example, from 8 months, we see parents reporting medians of `r min(mins$comprehension)` (`r mins$language[mins$comprehension == min(mins$comprehension)]`) and `r max(mins$comprehension)` (`r mins$language[mins$comprehension == max(mins$comprehension)]`) words. Intuitively, to many researchers (and parents) these high numbers feel unlikely. A spate of recent infancy experiments suggest that in fact, children in the second half of the first year do have some fragmentary representations of many common words available [e.g., @tincoff1999;@tincoff2012;@bergelson2012;@bergelson2017]. The representations revealed in these tasks are quite weak -- often amounting to a 2-5% difference in looking to a target on hearing a word uttered -- but, depending on the criterion used by parents, may be what is detected in these early reports. Thus, these estimates may not be as far off as we initially suppose.^[An alternative possibility is that *both* accounts are true, but unconnected: 8-month-olds could in fact know some common words, but parents could be overestimating their vocabulary based on observed behaviors -- in essence, parents could be right, but for the wrong reasons.]
005-vocabulary.Rmd:We next turn from the question of central tendencies to the question of variability. One of the most important features of early vocabulary development is its variability [@fenson1994]. To examine variability, we switch to a view of the data that reveals the full range of variation across the samples in the database. Examining Words and Sentences data, we can see that across every language in the database there is a tremendous range of vocabulary sizes reported. How systematic is this variability?^[@feldman2000 discusses the possibility that some portion of the observed variability in her data as well as the CDI norming data [@fenson1994] is due to reporting issues. In their response, @fenson2000 cite an unpublished dataset comparing lab-based elicited production and parent report for 36 object names and show that the standard deviation is greater than the mean on both measures, suggesting that the variability found in CDI scores is not artifactual.]
006-demographics.Rmd:One important tension in this chapter reflects many earlier discussions of variability in CDI scores [from @fenson1994, @feldman2000, and @eriksson2012, among others]. While some demographic differences in vocabulary are quite consistent -- substantially so, as it turns out -- the overall proportion of variance in vocabulary that they capture is still relatively limited. We will examine a number of different perspectives on how to quantify this relationship, moving back and forth between emphasizing consistency in differences in the central tendency and emphasizing the limited size of these effects relative to the variability documented in Chapter \@ref(vocab).
006-demographics.Rmd:Our first analysis examines how vocabulary development differs by children's sex.^[Throughout, we will assume that parents report on children's biological sex, rather than their gender identity.] The literature on cognitive differences due to sex is vast, controversial in many places, and difficult to summarize [see @miller2014 for a useful recent review]. Focusing on development, @maccoby1974 began the enterprise of systematizing and summarizing gender differences. Their conclusions were largely deflationary but did suggest some differences in aggression and verbal ability (which were suggested to emerge in the period of early adolescence). This latter claim is most relevant for our analysis, but has been subject to controversy as well. Using meta-analytic tools, @hyde1988 found that differences in verbal ability were minimal, but more recent studies have suggested consistent verbal ability differences. For example, @stoet2013 found differences in reading ability across nations in a massive elementary education dataset (the PISA assessment), with variance in the magnitude of difference, but with girls very consistently showing an advantage. Similarly, @robinson2011 reported consistent differences in reading ability (favoring girls) at the onset of kindergarten in a nationally-representative US sample. 
006-demographics.Rmd:Our first plot shows comprehension on Words and Gestures. Visual inspection of the data suggest limited differences, but a female advantage in some languages (most pronounced in Korean, Latvian, and Hebrew). Note that many authors do not find gender differences in early comprehension [e.g., @eriksson2012]. @feldman2000 also did not using a large, relatively representative American dataset, though they had data only from younger children (10-13 months). 
006-demographics.Rmd:Do these differences reflect differences in measurement that are unique to the CDI? One way of addressing this question is to examine other studies of gender differences that have been found in other studies. Unfortunately, many of the studies reporting differences themselves rely on the CDI, likely for the reasons reviewed in Chapter \@ref(intro-practical), e.g. [@bauer2002;@fenson1994;@feldman2000]. For example, @feldman2000 collected CDIs with a large dataset of low-income American English speakers at 12 and 24 months. In those data, early comprehension showed no significant gender differences, but production at 24 months showed a difference comparable to what we observed here ($N = 2156$, $d = .35$, recomputed from provided summary statistics). These data, while providing replication in an independent dataset, do not speak to whether reporting biases contributed to or created the observed sex effects. 
006-demographics.Rmd:Second, @bornstein2012 use a particularly powerful study design to examine stability in early language estimates across different measures. They gathererd longitudinal data at 20 and 48 months using a wide range of standardized and parent-report measures, and then use structural equation modeling to model shared variance due to parent report as well as standardized latent language ability at each age. We digitized data from their Figure 2 to examine the size of the gender differences in the latent vocabulary construct that they recovered.^[These data are not perfect, I have double-digitized one point.] As these scores are standardized, we can examine the difference in means and recover the standardized effect size for gender in the data, which is `r round(-diff(b2012_summary$Mean), 2)` standard deviations. Since this measurement is *greater* than that found using the CDIs (the comparable American English measurement was `r round(filter(analyses$WS.production$sex$mmad_summary, language == "English (American)") %>% pull(mmad_mean), 2)`), we doubt that our observed effect is due solely to reporting bias. 
006-demographics.Rmd:Another factor that may contribute to individual differences in children's vocabulary development is birth order.  The literature suggests some evidence for a first-born advantage in early vocabulary development, but these differences are small and tend to be most evident early in development.  For example, @bornstein2004 found that mothers report larger receptive and expressive vocabularies in their first-borns. Using naturalistic language samples, @berglund2005 found that first-born children reached the 50-word milestone earlier than later-born children, but that birth order differences diminished later in development. Finally, @hoff-ginsberg1998 found that first-born children were more advanced in vocabulary development than later-born children, but that later-born children were more advanced in their conversational skills. This may be attributed to “differences in early language experience” that “may set the stage for later developmental differences” (p. 603). 
006-demographics.Rmd:From health to education, children from lower socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds tend to be at higher risk for a variety of negative developmental outcomes, compared to their higher-SES peers [@bradley2002]. A large literature documents specific relations between SES and children’s early language abilities, especially oral vocabulary, which is in turn related to outcomes when children begin formal education [e.g., @hart1995; @hoff2003; @fernald2013]. The parent report method allows the assessment of the influence of SES on vocabulary outcomes earlier in development than is possible with direct assessments.  Using the CDI Words and Sentences form, @arriaga1998 compared the language skills in 103 very low-income toddlers with a sample of middle-income toddlers from the @fenson2007 norming sample, matched on age and sex. They found that the vocabulary production scores for the low-income group were consistently about 30% lower than those for the middle-income group.  The size of these effects suggest that differences in SES are evident from the earliest phases of language development. 
006-demographics.Rmd:In the current dataset, we have the opportunity to explore the extent of these effects across several language communities.  Cross-language comparisons may shed light on the factors that lead to relations between SES and children’s vocabulary outcomes. On the one hand, relatively constant relations across language communities that vary widely in indirect and direct factors that shape learning would provide prima facie support for genetic explanations. In contrast, a greater degree of cross-language variability would point to the origins of SES effects in aspects of children’s early environments that vary with SES to differing degrees across countries [e.g., @lfernald2012.  We use maternal education as a proxy for SES, following previous work suggesting that maternal education is strongly related to SES variation [@bornstein2003; @hoff2003].
007-gesture.Rmd:While the strong representational claims in these theories may be too extreme by modern standards, they do (correctly) predict the developmental continuity between early gesture use and children's later lexical and syntactic development [e.g., @bates1975; @thal1988]. For example, children's ability to point to distant objects is linked to the onset of the production of first words [@fenson2007;@brooks2008], and children with delayed onset of pointing are likely to also be delayed in first word production (ref). In addition, children's early gesture use is correlated with their later comprehension abilities [@bates1991], and children's use of gestures in combinations with words is linked to the later production of multiword combinations [e.g., @goldin-meadow1998, @iverson1994]. 
007-gesture.Rmd:These early correlational findings could simply reflect a common cause: Children who use gestures might also be better better at learning words. More recent studies have demonstrated more specific links between early gesture use and later lexical and syntactic development, however [e.g., @rowe2009].  For example, the particular lexical items that enter a child’s vocabulary are likely to be names for objects that are labeled using a gesture several months earlier [@iverson2005]. Moreover, early gesture vocabulary is specifically linked to later word vocabulary, whereas early gesture plus word combinations are linked specifically to children's later word combination skills [@rowe2009]. Taken together, the pattern of data suggests that children's early gestures provide an important social, communicative, and linguistic foundation for later language development.
007-gesture.Rmd:Early gestures serve many different functions. Children typically first begin to use "deictic gestures," for example, giving, pointing, or showing [e.g., @volterra1985].  Such deictic gestures are clear precursors to important linguistic and communicative functions, including establishing reference and promoting shared attention [@carpenter1998].  However, these deictic gestures do not necessarily have symbolic content per se [i.e., they do not stand for objects in the world, @bates1980]. Early on, pointing gestures generally may serve an imperative function, e.g., to request something from an adult, whereas, later, pointing is more likely to direct a caregiver's attention to another object or person [@bates1975; @masur1990; @vygotsky1980]. Children might also use gestures as part of a social activity, for example, waving "bye bye" or signaling "all done."  
007-gesture.Rmd:At first, social gestures might occur simply as imitations, but then later, a child may be able to produce these social gestures spontaneously in certain communicative contexts. Children's social gestures also reflect children's ability to engage in certain activities during pretend play, e.g., talking on a pretend phone or pretending to stir a soup. Such social gestures reflect children's ability to tune into contextual cues, mentally reconstruct activities, and engage in sequences of events.  Later, children's gestures might take on a "true" symbolic meaning, as a child might use a conventional gesture to recognize or classify objects as an instance of a category (e.g., pretend to drink from a cup or sniff a flower).  Children's ability to use gestures in this symbolic way may reflect a common underlying "vocabulary" in both the verbal and gestural domain [e.g., @acredolo1985; @bates1980].  
007-gesture.Rmd:A critical theoretical question in early communicative development concerns the relationship between language and gesture. As alluded to above, a number of early influential theories [e.g., @piaget1962; @werner1963] held that gesture and language should be intimately related becuase of their reliance on a shared system of symbolic reasoning. To the extent that they are underpinned by the same system, words and gestures should have related developmental trajectories--children who gesture early should also speak early and vice versa [@bates1991]. Following in the footsteps of @fenson2007, we ask this question at larger scale, and cross-linguistically. To assess this relationship, we will look at the correlations between children's gestural and linguistic vocabularies. 
010-aoapred.Rmd:Indeed, many theories of early word learning take multiplicity of cue types and mechanisms as a central feature [e.g., @hollich2000;@bloom2000]. As important as this work is, though, these studies typically are aimed at understanding how one or a small handful of words are learned in the laboratory under precisely-defined learning conditions. They do not directly address questions regarding the developmental composition and ordering of growth in the lexicon across many different children in their natural environments nor whether these patterns are consistent across different languages.
010-aoapred.Rmd:As our particular measures of environmental input, we estimated each word's (a) frequency in parent speech to children, (b) mean length of the parent utterances containing that word (MLU), (c) frequency as a sole utterance constituent, and (d) frequency in utterance-final position. While these measures are crude, they are both easy to compute and relatively comparable across the languages in our sample. To derive proxies for the meaning-based properties of each word, we accessed available psycholinguistic norms using adult ratings of each word's (a) concreteness, (b) valence, (c) arousal, and (d) association with babies. Integrating these two groups measures, which are based respectively on estimates of children's linguistic environment and words' meaning, we predict each words' acquisition trajectories. We assess the relative contributions of each predictor, as well as how those predictors change over development and interact with the lexical category of the word being predicted. Since vocabulary composition differs in comprehension and production [e.g., @benedict1979], we conduct our analyses on measures of each. 
010-aoapred.Rmd:What makes words easier or harder for young children to learn? Previous experimental work has largely addressed this question using small-scale lab studies. While such experiments can identify sources of variation, they typically do not allow for different sources to be compared directly. In contrast, observational studies allow the effects of individual factors to be measured across ages and lexical categories [e.g., @goodman2008;@hills2009;@swingley2017]. Such work has identified a number of candidate predictors of word learning. Our work expands the scope of these studies dramatically, leading to several new findings.
010-aoapred.Rmd:Second, predictors varied substantially in their weights across lexical categories. Frequent, concrete nouns were learned earlier, consistent with theories that emphasize the importance of early referential speech [e.g., @baldwin1995]. But for predicates, concreteness was somewhat less important. And for function words, MLU was more predictive, perhaps because it is easiest to decode the meanings of function words that are used in short sentences (or because such words have meanings that are easiest to decode). Overall, these findings are consistent with some predictions of both division of dominance theory, which highlights the role of conceptual structure in noun acquisition [@gentner2001], and syntactic bootstrapping theory, which emphasizes linguistic structure over conceptual complexity in the acquisition of lexical categories other than nouns [@snedeker2007]. More generally, our methods here provide a way forward for testing the predictions of these theories across languages and at the level of the entire lexicon rather than individual words.
011-categories_syntax.Rmd:Over the first few years, young children are exposed to a "sea of words" across many different contexts and from many different people [@goodman2008, p. 516]. And despite the fact that children vary tremendously in the rate at which they learn, the first words that children utter are strikingly consistent [@tardif2008;@schneider2015]: They tend to talk about important people in their life (*mom*, *dad*), social routines (*hi*, *uh oh*), animals (*dog*, *duck*), and foods (*milk*, *banana*) [@goodman2008, @bates1995; @nelson1973; @clark1979b]. Soon thereafter, they begin to add verbs (*go*) and adjectives (*pretty*) in greater proportions than earlier in development and may even begin to use closed-class forms, such as determiners (*the*). These patterns seem to suggest a developmental course that follows distinct "waves" of learning for words from different classes. That is, along with early social routines, nouns tend to predominate early vocabularies, while other types of words, such as predicates and closed class forms, are learned later. This pattern may be further qualified by differences in the types of words learned in comprehension vs. production [@benedict1979].   
011-categories_syntax.Rmd:Why do children learn nouns before verbs and other types of words? This question has received a great deal of attention in the literature, and we can briefly summarize some of the major issues here. One reason for this "noun bias" could be that nouns are simply more frequent in the talk to young children. It is well-established that children learn the words that they hear more often [e.g., @hart1995]. Many observational studies of English-speaking caregivers have demonstrated that caregivers use more nouns than verbs (types or tokens) with their children [e.g., @fernald1993; @goldfield1993; @gopnik1996; @kim2000; @poulindubois1995; @tardif1997].
011-categories_syntax.Rmd:Other researchers have framed the "noun bias" in terms of universals about what and how different words "partition" things in the world.For example, @gentner1978 has argued that children learn nouns before verbs because the meanings of nouns are easier to encode since they identify things that can be differentiated in the world (e.g., common everyday objects). Verbs and other predicates, in contrast, express *relations* among things in the world. Hence, the meanings of verbs are less accessible to children through common, everyday experiences and hence, are more difficult to map onto word forms without additional linguistic or social support. 
011-categories_syntax.Rmd:Other reasons that nouns might be easier than verbs for young children is that nouns tend to be less morphologically complex than verbs [e.g., @tardif1997]. For example, in many languages, nouns are typically marked only for number, whereas, verbs carry both person and tense information. In English, at least, verbs might also be harder to learn because they tend to occur in sentence-medial position (rather than sentence final), which make verbs less salient in the input that children hear [@slobin1985; @caselli1995].
011-categories_syntax.Rmd:Finally, differences in children's preferences for nouns vs. verbs might result from differences in what contexts children hear nouns vs. verbs in the speech from caregivers [e.g., @choi1995; @tardif1999]. Several researchers have examined what caregivers talk about using naturalistic data of caregiver-child interactions. For example, caregivers in some cultures tend to emphasize the names for objects, spending a great deal of time labeling objects for their children. In other cultures, caregivers do so much less frequently, instead focusing on the actions in which those objects engage [e.g., @fernald1993; @gopnik1996]. These differences in input to children can influence the words that are salient for children, and hence, the words that they are most likely to learn.
011-categories_syntax.Rmd:In sum, identifying the extent of cross-linguistic variation vs. universals has been difficult since variation across studies may be due to the different methodologies that are used. For example, even within a single language, for example, Korean, parent reports of children's first words find a noun bias [e.g., @au1994], whereas, studies using direct observational methods find less evidence for this pattern [e.g., @gopnik1996]. Further, few studies have had the scope to directly compare the extent of the noun bias across multiple languages using a common methodology. 
011-categories_syntax.Rmd:What might be the mechanism for these aysmmetries? For languages that do not allow argument dropping, producing a predicate typically requires producing other words as well -- English-speaking children do not often produce bare predicates, for example. Thus, predicate production may be limited by other constraints on production in such languages; in contrast, predicate comprehension has no such limits. Further, felicitous predicate production requires some ability to combine words syntactically; in contrast, comprehension of predicates (especially verbs) can often be accomplished by guessing based on known arguments [e.g., @gillette1999]. For these reasons, there may be a greater bias against predicates in production compared with comprehension. This explanation is consistent with our data, in which the average production predicate bias is `r signif(mean(filter(area_summary, form %in% WSs, measure == "produces", lexical_category == "Predicates")$mean), digits = 2)`, while the average for comprehension is `r signif(mean(filter(area_summary, form %in% WGs, measure == "understands", lexical_category == "Predicates")$mean), digits = 2)`. Thus, production comprehension asymmetries likely explain some part of the differences we observed above.
012-categories_semantics.Rmd:In this section, we isolate individual items from specific domains of interest. Our approach is to use the "universal lemma" mappings (see Chapter \@ref(methods)) to find matching lexical items across languages. The specific domains we consider are time, color, body parts, and logical words. We also investigated spatial prepositions and number words, but do not include them here. Spatial prepositions present a wide variety of mapping issues since lexical items "cut up" space differently across languages  [see e.g., @bowerman1996]. And number words are not found on enough CDI forms to have sufficient data for inclusion. 
014-grammar.Rmd:Broadly speaking, theoretical views on grammatical development generally take one of two forms. On nativist theories like Principles and Parameters [@chomsky1981;@baker2005], grammar emerges independently from lexical knowledge following its own, largely maturational, timetable.  Moreover, grammatical regularities are mentally represented in a format that is distinct from that used by the lexical system. In contrast, according to lexicalist theories, mental representations of morphosyntactic structure generally emerge from graded generalizations on the basis of lexical items, and at least early in development, there may be little or no representation of morphosyntactic rules or regularities *per se* [@tomasello2003, @elman1996]. Even when syntactic structures are eventually represented, these representations are directly related to more concrete lexical structures [@bannard2009].
014-grammar.Rmd:Historically, the study of individual differences has been critial to this debate.  While variation in word learning is generally uncontroversial, individual differences in grammatical development are less clearly predicted under a universalist, nativist perspective.  In contrast, lexicalist theories predict that variation in grammatical development should be tightly yoked to variation in lexical development [@bates1999]. Research has shown that, as with lexical development, there is sizeable variation in exactly when and how children move into using more grammatically complex utterances in their everyday speech.  While some children use primarily multi-word phrases and many closed class forms by 24 months, other children are still primarily producing nouns in single word utterances at that same age [e.g., @bates1988; @bates1999].  Moreover, there is also variation in the kinds of multi-word utterances that children produce.  For example, some children build up sentences from individual words (e.g., *want dat!*), whereas other children seem to produce utterances that reflect "unanalyzed" chunks of more complex speech (e.g., *iwantdodat!*).
014-grammar.Rmd:Associations between individual differences in lexical and grammatical development have been robustly substantiated in the literature. In the original norming data from the English CDI: Words & Sentences, children with more sophisticated grammatical productions were also those children with the largest vocabularies [@bates1994]. Using that same dataset, @marchman1994 found that size of verb vocabulary was concurrently related to children's overregularization of past tense inflections (e.g., *daddy goed*), productions that are viewed as a major milestone in the development of grammatical rule-based knowledge. Links between lexical development and grammar have also been reported longitudinally [@bates1988; @bates1997], in late talkers [e.g., @paul1996;@rescorla2000;@rescorla1997;@thal1997], early talkers [@thal1996;@thal1997], and children with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Williams syndrome [e.g., @singerharris1997]. Similar relationships have also been demonstrated in many other languages, including Slovenian [@marjanovic2013], Hebrew [@maital2000], Icelandic [@thordardottir2002], Italian [@caselli1999;@devescovi2005], Bulgarian [@andonova2015], Finnish [@stolt2009], Spanish [@mariscal2012; @thal2000], and German [@szagun2006]. 
014-grammar.Rmd:While these studies substantiate that vocabulary and grammar development are strongly associated developmentally, the interpretation of these relations is still under debate. Some researchers have interpreted these links to suggest that domain-general learning mechanisms guide the child’s construction of a working linguistic system at many different levels, in this case, learning words and learning grammatical rules [e.g., @elman1996].  As @bates1987 proposed many years ago, “the native speaker learns to map phrasal configurations onto propositions, using the same learning principles and representational mechanisms needed to map single words onto their meanings” (p. 163). Other proposals suggest that the process of learning words involves learning both their lexical-semantic and their morphosyntactic properties (e.g., in what constructions they can legally appear and what inflectional morphemes are required), and that grammatical knowledge is generally built up on a case-by-case basis [@tomasello2003]. Early word combinations are often highly routinized and situation specific, suggesting that learning grammar, like word learning, is guided by learning mechanisms that are item specific and frequency dependent. It is only later that grammatical structures become encoded in terms of their abstract syntactic form [e.g., @lieven1997; @tomasello2003]. Yet other accounts view the relation as reflecting mechanisms that operate in the opposite direction. On these views, grammatical analysis is a driving force behind word learning, such that the process of analyzing sentences into their constituent grammatical parts facilitates the further acquisition of lexical-semantic knowledge [@anisfeld1998;@naigles1990].  Finally, other studies have proposed that the lexical-grammar relations may not be as direct as previously proposed, actually being driven by common third-party influences such as the speech that children hear [@hoff2017].
014-grammar.Rmd:Two studies provide evidence against this deflationary hypothesis. First, @moyle2007 used a variety of instruments to provide evidence for the same relation in both typically-developing and late-talking children. Second, @brinchmann2018 give a similar analysis using cross-lagged structural equation models. Critically their work relied only on direct testing of the child (not parent report) using standardized instruments. In their model, they found a strong correlation between the time-invariant (trait-like) components of vocabulary and grammar ($r = 0.72$). While this correlation is smaller than the correlations we report, it is still quite large -- and it appears in a model that also controls for a number of other relationships. Intriguingly, however, this study suggests that as grammar-lexicon correlations are cross-lagged, grammar to vocabulary links are stronger than vocabulary to grammar links, and neither are that strng This finding suggest that syntactic bootstrapping effects -- as well as correlations driven by shared input may be responsible for the relationship between the two abilities. Regardless, these two studies suggest that reporting bias is very likely not the sole cause of the correlations we observded. 
014-grammar.Rmd:Our analyses go beyond earlier work by also investigating the relationship of age to vocabulary and grammar. One possibility is that age-related developments are dependent on maturational factors that operate on grammatical development in a domain-specific way, independent of lexical-semantic processes. Another possibility is that age-related effects represent more domain-general learning mechanisms, such as attention or working memory, that provide differential support for sentence-level processes than word-internal ones [@gathercole2013]. Future studies should also explore the extent to which lexical and age-related processes are shaped, either independently or in tandem, by features of the learning environments that children experience [e.g., @weisleder2013;@hoff2017;@brinkmann2018].
015-style.Rmd:One prominent candidate for a stylistic difference in language acquisition is the distinction between "referential" and "expressive" children. In an early report on individual differences in vocabulary acquisition, @nelson1973 noticed that there was substantial variation in how many nouns children had in thir vocabulary. She called children who had more than half of their vocabulary devoted to nouns "referential" children. They tended to have speech that was less syntactically complex and showed faster vocabulary growth. In contrast, "expressive" children had speech that was more syntactically complex and had fewer nouns. @dore1974 proposed a related version of this distinction, focusing on speech acts from two children in the middle of the second year and labeling them as "code oriented" (focused on labeling, similar to "referential") vs. "message oriented" (instrumental, social requests, similar to "expressive").
015-style.Rmd:Since this seminal work, the referential/expressive distinction has become enshrined in the literature as a canonical aspect of variation in children's style. Yet further debate about the consequences of this stylistic distinction continued in the literature. For example, @bates1988 observed a correlation between the proportion of nouns in the children's vocabulary and their vocabulary size and suggested the possibility that a referential style might be more effective for learning. Reacting to this claim, @pine1990 argued that the direction of causality might be reversed, however: perhaps having a bigger vocabulary (at least at a certain point) would lead to a greater representation for nouns.^[Caught up in this discussion is the question of whether there is a route into language via the memorization of "frozen phrases." This is an independent theoretical question that is difficult to address with CDI data as it is a question about the repetitive use of chunks of language in production. One observation is that, due to evidence of early verb generalization [e.g., @gertner2006], the original discussion about limited generalization in children's early syntax has been somewhat subsumed into a discussion about differences between general comprehension and conservative production.]
015-style.Rmd:While exploring the referential/expressive phenomenon more rigorously, @bates1994 presented analyses largely supporting that view: much systematic variation in the "referentiality" (proportion nouns) in children's vocabularies was due to the size of their vocabulary. As children's vocabularies grow, they tends to increase in their over-representation of nouns (as shown also in Chapter \@ref(categories-syntactic)). Thus, two children of the same age who have different proportions of nouns may also have different overall vocabulary sizes. After controlling for this factor, @bates1994 found only more limited evidence for stylistic variation. In the first subsection of this chapter, we pick up these analyses and apply them broadly to our dataset. 
015-style.Rmd:A second area of stylistic variation that has been much discussed is whether some children go through a vocabulary "spurt," defined as a change in the rate of vocabulary growth. The idea of a "spurt" or "explosion" occurs in a wide variety of discussions of early vocabulary [e.g., @nelson1973;@kamhi1986;@bates1988, see e.g., @dapretto2000 for review]. Clearly, from the average growth rates observed in Chapter \@ref(vocab), children's vocabulary growth accelerates dramatically during the period following first birthday and the emergence of production. Investigations of this acceleration have focused on two distinct features: its variation across children and its explanation. 
016-conclusions_consistency.Rmd:<!-- Beginning with the first monograph reporting the CDI norming study, @fenson1994 noted that variability is perhaps the primary and most striking fact about children's vocabulary learning. In Chapter \@ref(vocab), we quantified this variability and found that -- across languages and spanning children's second year -- the variability was as large as the central tendency.  -->
016-conclusions_consistency.Rmd:**Demographic differences**. In Chapter \@ref(vocab), we explored demographic differences in vocabulary. With very limited exceptions, we see a consistent advantage for girls over boys in early word learning across languages. Similarly, across (a smaller set of) languages, children with earlier birth orders are reported to have larger vocabularies. Both of these demographic differences should be considered in light of the probability of reporting biases -- for example, parents might *expect* girls to have larger vocabularies and hence report more words on average [though perhaps the consistency of the female advantage is surprising given variation in gender biases and stereotypes across countries, e.g., @nosek2009]. We return to the issue of difficulties in causal inference below. 
016-conclusions_consistency.Rmd:**Category biases**. In Chapter \@ref(categories-syntactic), we extend previous work [e.g., @bornstein2004] by quantifying the degree of bias for and against different word classes in early vocabulary. For example, with a handful of exceptions (discussed in depth in that chapter) we see a bias for the overrepresentation of nouns in early vocabulary, at the expense of predicates and, even more so, function words. 
016-conclusions_consistency.Rmd:Theorizing in language acquisition has traditionally argued on the axes defined by the nativist/empiricist debate, as well as the debate between domain-general and domain-specific representations and mechanisms. We label the implied axis of the debate here as the continuum between domain-general, empiricist theories and domain-specific, nativist theories. Anchoring one side of this continuum are statistical learning theories, that posit that domain-general mechanisms that learn structure from continuous input can induce structure from linguistic input [CITES: rethinking innateness, etc.]. On the other side are content-nativist theories that posit language-specific representational structures, such as the Principles and Parameters theory [@chomsky1981, @baker2005]. 
016-conclusions_consistency.Rmd:For all the reasons described above, we do not believe that the observed consistencies directly bear on traditional questions of the mechanisms underlying language acquisition. Taking the correlation between grammar and the lexicon as a case study: theoretical proposals from many parts of the space shown in Figure \@ref(fig:theoryspace) can account for these data. For example, a purely bottom-up statistical generalization mechanism would clearly produce a correlation between lexical and grammatical structure [as in @bates1997's original propopsal]; statistical generalizations require lexical data and so more data should correlate with more generalization. But a more domain-specific nativist grammatical proposal might also produce this correlation, provided that it required triggering data [e.g., @gibson1994, @yang2015tolerance]. And many variations in between. 
017-conclusions_scale.Rmd:Developmental psychology often appears to be divided between two groups that do not communicate with one another. On the one hand, there are researchers interested in the ontogenetic and phylogenetic origins of knowledge -- the epistemological project of understanding how we reason about objects, communicate using language, or learn from other people [@carey2009, @spelke2007, @tomasellooriginoflanguage]. On the other hand, there are researchers interested in growth, change, and variation across individuals in psychometric constructs like executive function, working memory, and personality [@zelazo?, other cites]. The first type of research has led to a productive union of philosophical and psychological ideas, addressing many of the most exciting questions in the history of philosophy using empirical methods [@gopnik, @carey]. The second type has had success in its connections to educational policy [@nelson2007;@diamond2011, others?]. In many areas of research, these two traditions have little interchange with one another. They read different journals, record different measures, use different research designs and statisical models, and often appear to be pursuing entirely different goals. 
index.Rmd:The emergence of children's early language is one of the most miraculous parts of human development. The ability to communicate using language arrives with incredible rapidity -- most parents judge that their child is producing words with the intent to communicate before his or her first birthday [@schneider2015] and the onset of comprehension is even earlier [e.g., @bergelson2012;@tincoff1999]. 
index.Rmd:New words enter children's expressive vocabularies slowly at first, but this process accelerates over the second year such that children reach an average of 300 words by 24 months and more than 60,000 by the time they graduate from high school [@fenson2007]. At the same time, there are significant individual differences in the rate and timing of language acquisition. For example, although some 18-month-olds already produce 50--75 words, others produce no words at all, and will not do so until they are two years or older [e.g., @brown1973;@bloom2002;@clark2003].  
index.Rmd:A second contribution of the book is to develop theory treating the question of consistency and variability in early language. We introduce the notion of “process universals” -- that some aspects of the process of word learning may be universal across cultures and may lead to similarities in the dynamics of learning. These universals may arise due to the basic mechanisms of learning, memory, and social cognition that are at play in early vocabulary learning. This general idea has a long history in the field [e.g., @bates1989], but the Wordbank project provides an opportunity to lend new empirical data and analytic power to these ideas. This notion is contrasted with notions of “content” or “structural” universals in which particular principles regarding the structure of languages are innately given. 
index.Rmd:A number of the analyses reported here were first described in earlier conference proceedings or publications [e.g., @frank2016;@braginsky2015;@braginsky2016]. Rather than reprinting these verbatim, this manuscript updates them using the unified analytic approach and larger dataset described in Chapter \@ref(methods). The version of these analyses represented in this manuscript should be considered more definitive than any previously published or presented version.
