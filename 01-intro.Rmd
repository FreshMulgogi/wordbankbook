# Introduction {#intro}

The emergence of children's early language is one of the most miraculous parts of human development. The ability to communicate using language arrives with incredible rapidity -- most parents judge that their child is producing words with the intent to communicate before his or her first word before their first birthday [@schneider2015] and now several reports indicate that the onset of comprehension is even earlier [e.g., @bergelson2012,@tincoff2005]. Yet the path towards linguistic mastery is slow 

Almost uniquely in cognitive development, early language learning also offers an opportunity to study both consistency a

## Theoretical Foudnations: Theories of Language Acquisition

There are many approaches to studying language learning. We distinguish a couple of major touchstones theories so that we can refer back to them.

Theories of vocabulary acquisition:

+ Constraints and Biases [@markman1990]
+ Cross-situational Learning [@yu2007]

Theories of grammatical acquisition:

+ Constructivist
+ Principles and Parameters


### The Process Universals Viewpoint

+ Variation: Children vary tremendously. What predicts that variation? 
+ Consistency: Are there theoretical 

## Outline of the Book

Our analyses are organized by different ways of cutting our data:

+ Vocabulary: total numbers of words said or understood by individuals, examined via demographic and longitudinal methods.
+ Word categories: What word categories are learned earlier or later? How do these patterns vary across languages?
+ Individual words: What words are learned earlier or later? Are there demographic or category differences in words? 
+ Grammatical items: How does grammatical complexity change across development? How is it related to the growth of the lexicon?
+ Gesture items: How does gesture relate to early language?

But, we also discuss cross-cutting theoretical themes for each analysis.
